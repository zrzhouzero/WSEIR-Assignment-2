<P>
The names Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail have never figured very large in my 
adult vocabulary. Not that they weren't there. They were just too deep in 
memory for easy retrieval. 
</P>
<P>
Your average semi-macho guys, or even us everyday garden variety couch 
potatoes, just don't tend to hang onto those memories we formed before being 
checked out on two-wheel bikes. Unless we've had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I recently had a refresher course. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago, we were in the Lake District of Cumbria -- which is about hip 
high on the British Isles -- and having a pretty good time. There aren't a 
whole lot of places on this earth as pretty or as peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Many Lakes 
</P>
<P>
We were told there are 23 lakes. Someone else said there are 19, so I suspect 
the total number sort of depends on whether or not it rained recently. I do 
know that however many there are, they're in one of the most awe-inspiring 
settings. 
</P>
<P>
Mile after mile of rolling meadows, forests and mountains, their tops 
frequently lost in cloud. There are fields of wildflowers, waterfalls and about 
every green that nature's got. 
</P>
<P>
There are sheep -- armies of sheep, eating as fast as they can but never 
catching up with the growing landscape. And there's something else . . . a 
feeling that goes with the territory. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I were talking with Paul Carlin, a friend who'd come to the Lake 
District from London to manage the Borrowdale Gates Hotel near Keswick. He 
grinned as we raved about the countryside, as proud as if he'd created it 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Visitors From All Over 
</P>
<P>
"It's truly unique, you know, and I know what you mean about the feeling," 
Carlin said. "People come to the Lake District from your Wisconsin and 
Minnesota, where lakes are common. 
</P>
<P>
"Even from Colorado and British Columbia, whose mountains and lakes dwarf what 
we have here. And they're just as enchanted as everyone else. And I think I 
know the reason. It's not the lakes, you know." 
</P>
<P>
"What is it?" Joyce asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Carlin said, "I'm almost afraid to talk about it." He leaned forward 
and lowered his voice. "It may be something left over from the Druids or 
Merlin's time, but I think it's magic. I really believe there is a kind of 
enchantment here." 
</P>
<P>
We'd almost come to that conclusion on our own. You can't drive through the 
area without having that thought. We'd recently visited Dove Cottage, where 
William Wordsworth lived with his family. 
</P>
<P>
Though the cottage looks as if it's 300 years old, it's really kind of 
commonplace. The most unusual thing about it is that the children's rooms are 
wallpapered with newspapers. (The guidebook said Wordsworth thought it would 
make the rooms warmer in the winter.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Setting Is Unusual 
</P>
<P>
But it's not the cottage, it's the setting that makes it unusual. When you see 
the view from the room where Wordsworth did his writing, you begin to 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
You see Lake Grasmere cupped in rolling green hills, as still and reflecting as 
a mirror. The morning we were there, a few clouds were all but settling on its 
surface; you could feel a bit of the magic. 
</P>
<P>
There was no way a man of Wordsworth's talents could have lived in the area 
without becoming what he was -- a poet laureate, the greatest poet on nature 
that England has produced. 
</P>
<P>
"Wordsworth? Yes," Carlin said. " 'Lucy,' 'The Solitary Reaper' and 'Daffodils' 
are very nice. And you'll never convince me that James Hilton didn't spend some 
time here before he wrote about Shangri-La in 'Lost Horizon,' but I was 
thinking more in terms of Peter, Flopsy, Mopsy and Cottontail." 
</P>
<P>
"Who?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"Peter Rabbit!" Joyce exclaimed. "That's right! Beatrix Potter lived here in 
the Lake Country, didn't she?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Almost Missed House 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I meant by enchantment," Carlin said. "Her house is just down the 
way. I'll jot down some directions for you." 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't "just down the way" at all. It was a couple of lakes and a few dozen 
turns down a long road, but the trip wasn't a chore, because the country itself 
was satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
We missed the house the first time and had to backtrack. We'd have missed it 
again, except a small sign said, "Hill Top House," which my wife recognized 
from the stories. 
</P>
<P>
At first there didn't seem to be any true personality about the place. Slowly 
the lady herself, Beatrix Potter, began to take form as our guide walked us 
through the garden. 
</P>
<P>
"It's patterned after Mr. McGregor's garden," she said. "Does that ring a 
bell?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Interested 
</P>
<P>
It meant something to most of the visitors, including Joyce, whose interest in 
the garden was suddenly aroused. 
</P>
<P>
"Who's McGregor?" I asked. "Refresh my memory." 
</P>
<P>
No one answered. They were all listening as the guide led us into the house. 
She explained how Miss Potter had lived in an era that expected all proper 
young women to go from their father's house to their husband's. 
</P>
<P>
Beatrix, a very average-looking young lady who spent a good part of her 
growing-up years in the sparsely settled area, had been alone a lot. Having few 
callers and a great deal of time, she had taken to sketching and writing 
stories about the things she knew and loved, like the countryside and some of 
its inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
One of them was a very young rabbit, whom she named Peter. It wasn't much of a 
story. It dealt with Peter leaving his siblings -- Flopsy, Mopsy and 
Cottontail, who were "good little bunnies" -- and going out and losing the new 
coat his mother had made him. 
</P>
<P>
He lost it when he was almost caught by Mr. McGregor, whose garden Peter had 
been told never to visit. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Limited Edition 
</P>
<P>
In 1902, probably more on the strength of the sketches than the stories, a 
London publisher took a chance and brought out a limited edition of "The Tale 
of Peter Rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
There were no limitations from then on. Beatrix Potter wrote and illustrated 
more than 25 children's books, which were published in dozens of languages, to 
the delight of millions of children. And then their children and their 
children's children. 
</P>
<P>
"Did Beatrix Potter have children of her own?" someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
"She eventually married a man named William Heelis," the guide answered, "but 
she was childless." 
</P>
<P>
A woman asked if Miss Potter had been able to enjoy any of her success, or 
whether fame had only come after her death. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a very canny lady who enjoyed huge success and made a great deal of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Purchased Land 
</P>
<P>
The tour group grew silent. 
</P>
<P>
"In fact," said the guide, "she loved the district so, that to have some 
control over what might happen to it, she began slowly buying up more and more 
property in the area to keep it from being destroyed by what the world calls 
'progress.' 
</P>
<P>
"In addition to her writing, she spent her time working to protect all of this 
part of Cumbria, to keep it pure and unspoiled for all time. Her efforts are 
largely responsible for the fact that this whole district is now under the 
protection of the National Trust. God willing, and thanks to Beatrix Potter, it 
may be protected forever." 
</P>
<P>
The tour ended and we left the house, a few feet behind a young family. As we 
entered the garden again, a bird flew out of the hedge just in front of us. The 
daughter of the family, a girl of perhaps 4 or 5, heard the rustling noise and 
turned quickly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Thought She Saw Him 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, papa," she said excitedly. The mother and father stopped and turned. The 
little girl spoke excitedly to her parents in a language neither Joyce nor I 
could understand. Her father answered her and then smiled at us. 
</P>
<P>
"She wants to know was that Peter Rabbit who just came out of the bushes. I 
told her I didn't know because I had not seen." 
</P>
<P>
The little girl thought for a few seconds and then, nodding her head firmly, 
spoke again. Her father translated. 
</P>
<P>
"She says she thinks it was Peter Rabbit, that she thinks she caught a glimpse 
of him." The little girl ran around looking under rose bushes and behind hedges 
for another glimpse as we approached the gate cottage. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Interesting Theory 
</P>
<P>
Almost as a conspirator, the father shared a final thought with his wife and 
with us. "It probably was not really Peter Rabbit, you know. That rabbit would 
be 85 years old now." He winked. "Probably one of his children or his 
grandchildren, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
Carlin stopped by our dinner table in the hotel dining room that night and 
asked if we'd made it to Hill Top House and what we thought of his theory. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't tell us what the lady had done for the district." 
</P>
<P>
"Or," Joyce said, "that it was Peter Rabbit that really started it all." 
</P>
<P>
"And, I'll bet," Carlin said, "that they told you Beatrix Potter never had any 
children, too." 
</P>
<P>
"You mean she did?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
"The way I see it, she had millions of children . . . generations of millions 
of children," he said. "And didn't she leave them a lovely garden to play in?"
