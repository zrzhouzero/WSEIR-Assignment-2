FIXING THE WRONG THING 
</P>

When the two national political parties begin working together to make things 
"better," better beware. During the last campaign, Democrats and Republicans 
formed a commission to grab sponsorship of the last presidential debate away 
from the League of Women Voters. The result was that the two presidential 
campaigns were able to dictate ground rules that resulted not in a real debate 
but in an excessively restricted and programmed question-answer session.

Now the parties have joined in a new bipartisan commission to do something 
about the national political conventions. The commission has been directed to 
propose ways of streamlining the conventions so that they are more appealing to 
Americans on television. This is in obvious response to the poor ratings that 
the conventions drew last summer and to network television's reluctance to 
carry the entire proceedings. Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the retiring Republican 
national chairman, said that there had been criticism from the media that the 
conventions "have become nothing more than staged activities in which nominees 
give canned speeches."

The problem is that this dog is barking up the wrong tree. What needs fixing is 
the pre-convention nominating process that goes on forever and produces winners 
long before the delegates gather. The prospective nominees thus have control of 
the convention program and arrange things so that there is a minimum of 
uncertainty and controversy. This year even the names of the vice presidential 
running mates were known in advance, so the conventions were robbed of any 
remaining tidbit of suspense. 
</P>
<P>
What the national parties must do is shorten the primary campaign and start it 
someplace other than Iowa or New Hampshire. They need to be willing to have 
actual issues debated on the convention floor. They need some spontaneity and 
real action -- perhaps even a multiple roll-call contest for the nomination. 
They do not need more programming, but less. Fix the primary process, and the 
convention problem will fix itself.
