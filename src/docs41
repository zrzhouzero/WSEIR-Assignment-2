ISRAELI COALITION AND ARAFAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For once, before offering such generous but the unasked for advice, put 
yourselves in Israel's place (editorial, "Israel: Starting Over," Dec. 21). The 
tiny country is surrounded by vicious enemies, who not only hate the Jewish 
state (as well as other non-Arab entities in the area: the Kurds, the Copts, 
the Armenians, etc.) but also each other. 
</P>
<P>
Who has Israel to talk to? The cowardly Jordanian monarch? Egypt, a country 
rocked by pro-Khomeini unrest, whose population has never accepted peace with 
Israel, and whose armed forces are being mindlessly and continuously 
strengthened by Western states? Iraq, Syria, Lybia -- all of whom control the 
Palestine Liberation Organization? 
</P>
<P>
Why is it that The Times does not urge totalitarian Arab states and terrorist 
organizations to put down their weapons, and stop all provocations? And what of 
"an international peace meeting?" 
</P>
<P>
Who will decide the future of Israel, who will guarantee its existence? 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet Union, an archaic colonial empire, whose unity is cemented by tanks 
and the blood of martyred White Russians, Ukrainians, Afghans, and the Balts? 
The United States, whose loyalty to its allies can be eloquently witnessed to 
by the late Shah of Iran, the betrayed anti-Castro Cubans of the Bay of Pigs, 
the Contras, the South Vietnamese? Or maybe pro-Arab France and Greece will 
guarantee Israel's right to exist? 
</P>
<P>
Israel has no choice but to forge a strong coalition, maintain a unity 
government, strengthen itself, and realize that in this world nobody can 
guarantee anything. The best Israel will get, if it depends on such generous 
advice, as The Times has given it, is a motion picture about its destruction. 
We will all cry and wonder why the second Holocaust was allowed. 
</P>
<P>
If the Israeli government decides to build Jewish settlements in the historic 
Jewish land, then it must do so -- without waiting for advice from a slanted 
and biased American media, whose news reporters eagerly write "Israeli-occupied 
West Bank," but never write "Soviet-occupied Estonia," or "provocative Arab 
plans for the destruction of Israel."
