<P>
Median prices and sales of resale detached houses and condominiums rose in 
November, according to the California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
November sales of detached houses in California rose 4.9% over October, thanks 
to a brief dip in interest rates and strong demand. 
</P>
<P>
Detached houses sold at an annual rate of 597,000 in November compared to 
569,330 in October. The November figure was 17% higher than last November 
making it the highest in a decade.

<P>
The state's median sales price for resale houses rose 1.2% in November to 
$177,485. This was a 23.6% jump from November, 1987, when the median was 
$143,554. Joel Singer, chief economist of the realtors' group, said lack of 
inventory helped to cause the price rise.

Condominium resales rose 0.2% over October but 48.4% over November, 1987. The 
median condominium price fell 2.7%, to $126,328 in November from $129,869 in 
October. Even so, November's median price was 10.4% higher than a year ago, 
when it was $114,457.
