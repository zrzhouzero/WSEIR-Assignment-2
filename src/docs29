SUDDENLY POPULAR after nearly a century of neglect, stencil painting now 
decorates nursery walls and furniture, living and dining room walls and floors. 
Stenciling became prominent in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries, when it 
was used to imitate wallpaper. In the American colonies, stenciled designs were 
used on floors, on furniture and on canvas or oilcloth floor coverings.

The process is simple: A stenciler, using a craft knife, cuts various shapes in 
a piece of sturdy, usually waxed, paper, and then applies paint to a surface 
through those cutouts. The beauty of stenciling is the ease of repetition: 
Complicated swag-and-bouquet borders can be applied to walls in a fraction of 
the time (and without the requisite talent) it would take someone to paint them 
by hand. Stenciling can be a very satisfying craft, because the end result, 
when done well, looks professionally neat and precise.

Although stenciling is easy enough to attempt on your own -- with just some 
paper, a craft knife, paint and brushes -- a small test project before 
launching into a total-room experience is a good idea. The hardest thing to 
master is the correct consistency of the paint. Think dry. And the stencil 
brush (shaped like a blunt, long-handled shaving brush) should be wielded with 
an up-and-down motion; wiping brings disaster. The surface to be stenciled 
determines the consistency of the paint; cloth can take more paint on the 
brush, but a floor previously painted with something like diamond-hard deck 
enamel will resist all paint.

 Many how-to books on stenciling have been published; Dover Books has issued a 
series of books of stencil designs on thick paper, ready for cutting. 
Stenciling supplies and classes are offered at Judy's Carousel Crafts and 
Rainbow Craft, both in Burbank, and at Craf-T-Mac's in La Habra. Supplies are 
available at Aaron Bros. stores, Kit Kraft in Studio City, Stat's in Pasadena, 
and Michael's in Torrance. UCLA Extension plans to offer a stenciling class in 
the spring quarter.
