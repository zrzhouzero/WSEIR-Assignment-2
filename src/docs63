LONG BEACH URGED TO HELP HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe for the New Year . . . the Long Beach city administration might . . . 
officially help the homeless in the Long Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
As an article in the Long Beach section showed (Times, Dec. 22), local 
restaurants, such as Vincent Williams' Golden Bird chicken outlets, donate food 
to the Long Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Other restaurants such as Justina's in downtown Long Beach, Domino's Pizza and 
Twin Wheels Steak House have jumped on the bandwagon in giving food to the Long 
Beach Family Shelter for the Homeless. 
</P>
<P>
So when will the Long Beach City Council . . . jump on the bandwagon and take 
official action to help the homeless as recommended by the city's task force in 
1987? Will they do something in early 1989?
