BAALBEK, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scantily dressed dancers are long gone. The last liquor store was blown up 
six years ago. This ancient Roman city now is the Lebanese capital of Shia 
Muslim fundamentalism. 
</P>
<P>
Public drinking and dancing are forbidden now, but brief male-female unions 
called "pleasure marriages" are condoned. 
</P>
<P>
On the surface at least, life in Baalbek is governed by the dictates of 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's stern brand of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran, 
which to Western eyes appears joyless and forbidding. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing makeup or jewelry in public is taboo. So is singing and dancing at 
mixed gatherings because, as one woman noted, "it causes psychological 
imbalance and tempts men." 
</P>
<P>
But when the sun goes down and the doors are locked, the black robe-like 
chadors Shia women have to wear in public are discarded in favor of shorts and 
strapless tops, along with makeup and perfume. 
</P>
<P>
"People think we're made of stone just because we cover ourselves with chadors. 
But we're not. We're ready to do anything to please our husbands," said Selma, 
a housewife. 
</P>
<P>
Before Lebanon's civil war erupted in 1975, Baalbek was a cultural center where 
dance and theatrical festivals were held in the breathtaking Roman 
amphitheaters. 
</P>
<P>
Now the ruins echo with Islamic slogans as the fundamentalists stage political 
rallies there, chanting ritual denunciations of "Death to America! Death to 
Israel!" The amphitheaters have also been used as mortar positions in Lebanon's 
sectarian fighting. 
</P>
<P>
The Shias' strict life style has drawn bitter criticism from many Lebanese, 
Muslims and Christians alike who say that the fundamentalists' "double 
standards" have brought Islam into disrepute. 
</P>
<P>
Most Shias in Baalbek belong to Hezbollah (Party of God), which is believed to 
be an umbrella for Shia kidnapers holding most of the 16 foreigners missing in 
Lebanon. It's made up of zealots blindly loyal to Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
"We follow whatever Khomeini decrees. Whatever he rejects, we reject," said 
Zeinab Nasser, an administrator at the women's "haouzeh," or religious center, 
in Baalbek. 
</P>
<P>
The practice of pleasure marriage is one of the many customs frowned on by 
other Lebanese, especially moderate Shias and Sunnis. 
</P>
<P>
In a pleasure marriage, a young woman who would not dare expose a curl of her 
hair from under her chador can take on an unlimited number of lovers in the 
name of religion. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the women who take part in pleasure marriages are considered 
respectable and far from promiscuous. 
</P>
<P>
The practice is widespread in Iran, where the overwhelming majority of the 54 
million population is Shia. 
</P>
<P>
Nasser said the Prophet Mohammed sanctioned pleasure marriage, making it 
acceptable for a couple to marry for a specified period that could last "for an 
hour, two days, a month or as long as they desire." 
</P>
<P>
"It's all perfectly legal and provisions are made for any child born after the 
marriage contract expires," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
She said pleasure marriage is especially practical amid Lebanon's economic 
crisis because "men cannot afford a regular marriage, and let's face it, they 
have physical needs. 
</P>
<P>
"If these cannot be met within a permanent marriage, pleasure marriage provides 
the outlet," she added. "It's much better than doing it illicitly." 
</P>
<P>
No cleric is required to perform the ceremony. The woman, who should preferably 
be either divorced or widowed, tells the man, "I give myself to you in 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
He responds: "I accept." And that's it. 
</P>
<P>
Virgins need the consent of their parents, but they often do not seek it. 
</P>
<P>
As for forms of entertainment, the fundamentalists permit classical music 
"because it does not have any negative psychological effects," Nasser said. 
</P>
<P>
She observed that a scientific report proved that loud music is bad for "the 
nerves and the blood circulation." 
</P>
<P>
Like other factions in Lebanon, where the government has collapsed, the Shias 
have established their own medical and welfare systems, amply funded by Iran. 
</P>
<P>
Abbas Mousavi, a Hezbollah leader, said: "Social work has become one of our 
main responsibilities because of the catastrophes that have befallen Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
"We've founded the Imam Khomeini Hospital here, which provides free medical 
treatment. There are similar centers in other Shia areas." 
</P>
<P>
He noted: "We've also founded pharmacies that make a very small profit, as well 
as schools, which we hope will accommodate 6,000 students in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
"We've given money to needy families and bought deep-bore drills to provide 
wells in remote villages, especially those we consider to have military or 
political importance." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about complaints on restrictions against alcohol and nightclubs, Mousavi 
noted: "We're not imposing Islamic values on people. No one can say we've 
raided houses where people gamble or drink." 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the bombing of liquor stores and clubs, he conceded: "There were 
incidents where young men acted out of Islamic zeal after witnessing aberrant 
behavior. But Hezbollah is against that."
