The Queen of England rewarded 907 people, from a beekeeper to a banker to 
ex-Trade and Industry Minister Leon Brittan, with titles or medals in her 
traditional New Year's honors list. Brittan, who resigned after leaking a 
secret document in 1986, was granted a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, as was 
sculptor Eduardo Paolozzi. Also on the list, mostly compiled on the 
recommendation of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government, were newly 
dubbed knight Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of N. M. Rothschild &amp; Sons and 
a member of the well-known banking family's British branch, and British 
Beekeeping Society Vice Chairman William Hooper, named a Member of the Order of 
the British Empire. Actor Peter Cushing, known for horror films and for 
portraying Sherlock Holmes, was made an Officer of the Order. Among several 
athletes honored was six-time world darts champion Eric Bristow, who became a 
Member of the Order and the first in his field to be so recognized.

 -- Bandleader Cab Calloway, who had to cancel a New Year's Eve appearance in 
Chicago because of illness, relayed greetings to his fans through his wife, 
Nuffie. "I wish everyone a Happy New Year," she quoted the "prince of hi-de-ho" 
as saying after she visited him at White Plains (N.Y.) Hospital Center. 
Calloway has been listed in critical but stable condition since emergency 
surgery for unspecified abdominal troubles that caused him to collapse Dec. 21 
during a concert tour in Japan. Nuffie Calloway said her husband, 81, "thanks 
everyone for their calls, flowers, letters and expressions of love, and he 
expects to feel better any minute."

 -- As he packed up office memorabilia recently in Newark, N.J., retiring 
Democratic Rep. Peter W. Rodino Jr. looked back on his 40 years in Congress. He 
recalled rushing past reporters after the Judiciary Committee he chaired voted 
articles of impeachment against President Richard M. Nixon in 1974, saying he 
went into a cubbyhole office, telephoned his wife and wept. Rodino, 79, pointed 
proudly to photographs of himself with President John F. Kennedy and his 
brother Robert, President Lyndon B. Johnson and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
Democrat Donald M. Payne will succeed Rodino, becoming the state's first black 
congressman. DAVE JOHNSON
