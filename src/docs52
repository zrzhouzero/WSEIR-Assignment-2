Letter From England 
</P>
<P>
From Mary Evans of Great Britain: "I would dearly love to visit California, and 
preferably not as a 'package tourist.' So I'm wondering whether any of your 
readers would like to exchange a holiday with me? I'm a divorced, Irish-born 
woman in my early 50s. Self-employed and had my own antique shop for some 
years. Would be delighted to take my exchange visitor out to London, antique 
shops, country houses and show her (or him) around. I live 45 miles from 
London." 
</P>
<P>
The idea is for the Californian, in turn, to host Mrs. Evans in the United 
States. Her address: 97 Newport Road, Woburn Sands, Milton Keynes, England MK17 
8UN.
