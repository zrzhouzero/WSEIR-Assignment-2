Oil from a ruptured Shell Oil Co. pipeline floated down the Mississippi River 
and forced cleanup crews to work round the clock to try to limit effects of the 
spill, a Shell spokesman in St. Louis said. Missouri Department of Natural 
Resources officials said the spill -- the worst in the state's history -- began 
Dec. 24 when a pipeline at Vienna, Mo., ruptured, allowing at least 336,000 
gallons of dichlorobenzene, a petroleum product, to flow into the Gasconade 
River. The spill has not caused problems with water supplies, but state 
officials said they could not measure the long-term effects on fish and 
wildlife in the Gasconade, Missouri and Mississippi rivers. Shell spokesman 
Tony Canino said that the cold weather prevented the oil from clinging to the 
river banks.
