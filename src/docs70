Twenty-seven people in Plymouth, Mass., were arrested on trespassing charges as 
125 activists demonstrated against the restart of the Pilgrim nuclear power 
plant, shut down since April, 1986, when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission 
branded it "one of the worst-run" nuclear plants in the country. Last week the 
plant started low-power testing, and it should be at full power in four months. 
The state has vowed to do everything possible to keep the plant from operating. 
Last month, Massachusetts voters rejected a referendum question that would have 
permanently closed Pilgrim and the Yankee plant in Rowe.
