Madonna and Beatty? 
</P>
<P>
A Madonna rep tells us -- and production sources confirm -- that the blond 
bombshell will play '30s nightclub singer-gangster's moll Breathless Mahoney 
opposite Warren, who has the title role in the long-delayed "Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
As Breathless she'll sing at least two original songs, yet unwritten. And 
she'll attempt to seduce the straight-laced copper away from lady love Tess 
Trueheart, who is yet to be cast. 
</P>
<P>
Beatty produces/directs the $30 million-plus Touchstone film, to begin 
production in February, to be filmed on the Universal lot, according to 
sources. Craig Modderno
