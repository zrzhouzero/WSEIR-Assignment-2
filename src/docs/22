Rodriguez's interview with corporate attorney Elsa Banuelos was dismaying. 
Banuelos states that she is "tired of translating" when called upon by client 
or other attorneys to assist them with the busboys. Would Banuelos feel just as 
tired, or rather, embarrassed, to translate while negotiating a contract with 
another attorney or a Spanish-speaking client? I think not. It is unfortunate 
that Banuelos is not proud of her ability to converse in Spanish, even if it is 
only used to ask the busboy for another glass of water.
