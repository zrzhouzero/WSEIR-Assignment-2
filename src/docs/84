BOGOTA, Colombia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 150 miles from Bogota lie the mines of Muzo and Coscuez, the biggest 
emerald deposits in the world. The car drive from the Colombian capital over a 
potholed track takes eight to 10 hours. 
</P>
<P>
To Santa Barbara, a small town 5 miles from the mining centers, the land is a 
lush green. Thereafter, the terrain is a gray bleakness. The wild mountain 
peaks are covered from morning until evening in a cloak of mist as if nature 
seeks to hide its treasures. 
</P>
<P>
The houses in Santa Barbara are made of wood, despite the millions of pesos to 
be made in the town every day. There are no hotels, not even hostels for the 
simple traveler. Yet the finest and most expensive Scotch flows, and fortunes 
are squandered in the town's bars and dives. 
</P>
<P>
The neighboring town of Muzo usually has about 5,000 residents, but during an 
emerald boom -- and that happens whenever a new seam is discovered -- the 
population soars to 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Warnings Issued 
</P>
<P>
For those unacquainted with the land, the journey into the mining zone can be 
extremely dangerous. Tourists are warned to stay away. The area has been dubbed 
the "Land of 1,001 Nights" and the "Devil's Caldron." 
</P>
<P>
Wild rags-to-riches stories go the rounds in Muzo and Coscuez, where 
millionaires have been made overnight. Thousands of adventurers have lost their 
lives in bloody fighting among themselves. Numerous crosses planted by the 
roadside or dotting the fields are silent testimony to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
The emerald is a form of beryl, a mineral found principally in granite and 
granite pegmatites. It is prospected in its pure form as a precious stone and 
is green or blue-green in color. 
</P>
<P>
"The most valuable are the so-called 'oil drops' and 'water eyes,' veritable 
masterpieces of nature for which vast sums are paid," explained a jeweler in 
Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
The precious stones prospected in Muzo and Coscuez are sent to Bogota to be 
valued by experts. Shine, purity and color determine the price. 
</P>
<P>
Emerald mines can also be found in Brazil, Africa, Australia, India and the 
Soviet Union. Japan even produces synthetic emeralds. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
State Owns Resources 
</P>
<P>
The deposits in Colombia were mined in pre-Columbian times. The present 
official prospector, the Compania Esmeraldas de Colombia, holds the concession 
from the state, which owns all mineral resources in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how much emerald is actually found in Colombia each year is 
difficult to answer, as great quantities of the precious stone disappear onto 
the black market. 
</P>
<P>
Official figures put the annual legal export of emeralds at $36.3 million. 
However, insiders reckon that between $100 million and $150 million worth of 
Colombian emeralds are marketed each year. 
</P>
<P>
The price of the stone depends on many factors, including ever-changing supply 
and demand, and the fluctuating rate of the dollar. Prospective purchasers are 
advised not to buy from strangers in the street, but to go to a respected 
jeweler. 
</P>
<P>
Distinguishing a fake from the real thing is not an easy task, even for the 
experts. Many a traveler has returned home with worthless glass instead of a 
valuable gem.
