Margaret Swett Plummer, one of the oldest rangers in the National Park Service, 
has died of a heart attack. She was 86.

<P>
Plummer worked at the John Muir Historical Site in Martinez.

She was regarded by authors and scholars as an invaluable source on naturalist 
John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, and her grandfather, John Swett, a 
pioneering California educator.

As a young girl, she would listen to her grandfather and Muir having passionate 
but amicable discussions.
