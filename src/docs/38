Go-o-o-d morning, Sacramento! Californians have some New Year's resolutions to 
propose: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Balance Proposition 103's attack on soaring insurance premiums with curbs 
on claim costs and attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Take responsibility for restructuring the Gann spending limit to fit 
current budget realities and quit bucking tough fiscal decisions to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Address the issues raised by the FBI sting, initiative mania and the 
Speakership wars by a comprehensive approach to government reform and not 
merely cosmetic tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Face the critical questions of what the quality of life in California 
should be and who should pay for it -- and stop ducking complex issues like 
health care, the environment, toxics, transportation, growth controls and 
regional government. 
</P>
<P>
How realistic are these resolutions? That's not easy to predict. Because what 
happens in Sacramento in 1989 will depend primarily on Gov. George Deukmejian, 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and the onslaught of reapportionment. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian's decision whether or not to seek reelection will influence policy 
direction. Will he be persuaded to run by advisers who argue he has the best 
chance to keep the governor's chair Republican and thus prevent a Democratic 
gerrymander in the 1991 reapportionment? 
</P>
<P>
Or, looking toward retirement, will he opt to abandon his stubborn naysaying 
and attempt to build a legacy? 
</P>
<P>
Early signals are mixed. After mellowing on Gann limit revisions, he's again 
mulling wholesale budget chopping. 
</P>
<P>
The pledge that Speaker Brown recently made to ease up on politicking and 
concentrate on policy-making could also help chart a positive course for state 
government. Again, signals are mixed -- in view of the partisan sniping at 
Deukmejian's nominee for state treasurer by Brown's lieutenants. 
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's definition of "doing policy" is crucial. Policy-making is not 
selectively taking over legislators' bills and ramming them through the 
Assembly. A "boutique" approach to problem-solving is not leadership. 
</P>
<P>
A leader allows lawmakers to nurture their own programs, and then protects 
their bills through the entire Legislature and the governor's office, too. He 
stands up to special interests who fund legislative campaigns and then stymie 
legislative action. (In 1989, the real test will be if Brown opposes the 
state's trial lawyers, key political supporters, for enactment of comprehensive 
insurance reform.) 
</P>
<P>
But the strongest influence may be reapportionment. To make policy, legislators 
have to get elected, and governors need legislative majorities of their own 
party. 
</P>
<P>
Will Assembly Republicans, led by their confrontational leader, Ross Johnson of 
La Habra, frustrate policy through partisan, obstructionist games designed to 
wound the Democratic majority before reapportionment? 
</P>
<P>
Will dissident legislative Democrats quiet down in exchange for a "kinder, 
gentler" redistricting? 
</P>
<P>
Will incumbents and leaders of both parties opt to play it safe -- and not risk 
any new policy initiatives before reapportionment can assure their continued 
political survival? 
</P>
<P>
Who can predict whether 1989 will bring an end to Sacramento's political 
gridlock? The denizens of the state Capitol might prefer to hibernate until 
reapportionment season. But perhaps, as Assemblyman Richard Katz of Sepulveda 
speculated, "If more solutions don't start coming out of this place, then no 
one will be around for reapportionment." 
</P>
<P>
If this prediction doesn't stir some resolve in Sacramento, nothing will.
