Leo Estrada's suggested model of middle-class Mexican-Americans creating 
country clubs for ourselves so as to pass on our advantages to our young is 
probably unnecessary. Instead, the Latino professionals profiled in the article 
could directly benefit the next Mexican-American generation by teaching them 
their skills. For example, the Cal Poly Pomona campus (where I teach) boasts 
14% Latino students, and its School of Business Administration, with the 
largest number of declared majors on campus who are Latino and black, regularly 
hires practicing financial consultants and lawyers on a visiting, part-time 
basis. Although the money isn't great, sweet satisfactions can derive from 
having a Latino student earn the top grade on a corporate finance exam (as just 
happened to me) or from submitting a proposal to the National Science 
Foundation to establish a Research Experience for Undergraduates Site where 
students may, under my guidance, undertake a yearlong study of attitudes and 
experiences of Latino MBAs in U.S. corporations.
