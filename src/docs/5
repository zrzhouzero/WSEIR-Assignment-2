Shirley Temple Black will be playing a return engagement in Pasadena when she 
presides over the Tournament of Roses Parade on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
As a curly-headed child star, she was grand marshal of the 1939 parade 50 years 
ago, the youngest in the parade's history. Now, she's been invited back to be 
grand marshal of the 100th Rose Parade, which starts Monday at 8 a.m. (to be 
covered on various TV stations; see Watchables for details). She joins a select 
group of others who have been grand marshals twice: Bob Hope, Richard Nixon and 
Earl Warren.

<P>
Riding in the parade with Mrs. Black this year will be her granddaughter, 
Teresa Falaschi, shown with her on the cover.
