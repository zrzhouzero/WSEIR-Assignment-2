President Francois Mitterrand stressed France's role in a unified Europe by 
delivering a New Year's Eve speech from Strasbourg, headquarters of the 
European Parliament. It was the first time a French head of state had made the 
traditional address to the nation from outside Paris. Mitterrand urged France's 
11 European Community partners to make 1989 a year of growth, saying: "Only a 
Europe united in technological, economic and monetary terms can rival Japan and 
the United States. Only a politically united Europe can hold up its head before 
the powers that dominate the world."
