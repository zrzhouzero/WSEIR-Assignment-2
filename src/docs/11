There could not be a more powerful combination than words by John Hersey and 
photographs by Ansel Adams. When the subject matter is "Manzanar" and the 
unconstitutional imprisoning of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the 
combination would seem to be explosive -- and is. 
</P>
<P>
Eloquent and moving, Hersey's 15,000-word essay details how this tragedy came 
into being: "The bitterest national shame of the Second World War for the sweet 
land of liberty: the mass incarceration, on racial grounds alone, on false 
evidence of military necessity, and in contempt of their supposedly inalienable 
rights, of an entire class of American citizens -- along with others who were 
not citizens in the country of their choice only because that country had long 
denied people of their race the right to naturalize." 
</P>
<P>
Equally moving are Adams' photographs, originally taken to document life in 
Manzanar, just a speck on the map in Inyo County in the rugged eastern Sierra 
before it became one of 10 camps established to hold about 120,000 
Japanese-Americans from 1942 to 1945. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Hersey's contribution occupies only the first 66 pages. Worse, 
Adams' pictures have been culled to less than half of the 204 pictures he 
donated to the Library of Congress. Many of these historic photographs are 
reproduced at sizes much smaller than snapshots developed in a hour at your 
corner photo shop. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of letting Hersey and Adams' words and pictures tell the story, the 
book dilutes the saga and turns it into another stereotypical tale of 
Japanese-Americana: how we overcame hardship and made the best of a bad 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
The titles of the three different contributions to the book indicate three 
different approaches: outrage in Hersey's "A Mistake of Terrifically Horrible 
Proportions," irony in Adams' "Born Free and Equal" and the bland in Armour and 
Wright's "A Portrait of Manzanar." 
</P>
<P>
Now that a redress bill has been passed by Congress and signed by the 
President, which would grant every living internee $20,000, the horrifying 
mistake of nearly 50 years ago has been officially rectified. But not the 
lasting impression that what the government did was wrong. For chipping away at 
this stone wall the book's authors and publisher have to be congratulated. 
</P>
<P>
But how much better it would have been for the book to at least mention that 
Ansel Adams' Manzanar photos, when put on display after 40 years, were 
criticized by some Japanese-Americans as "prettifying" the harsh camp 
experience. Or that many of those photographed carry hidden pyschological scars 
from the war fought within. Or that most of those photographed have long since 
died, never qualifying for the $20,000 and carrying to their graves the thought 
that they were "guilty" as never charged.
