In what is developing into a territorial skirmish over mosquitoes, two 
government agencies are swatting at each other over which of them would do a 
better job of combating the city's mosquito population. 
</P>
<P>
The Southeast Mosquito Abatement District, which oversees mosquito control in 
the central and northeastern sections of the city, wants authority over 
mosquitoes in the rest of Long Beach -- now the province of the city Department 
of Health and Human Services. District officials contend the health department 
is too busy fighting other public health threats, such as rats, to pay 
sufficient heed to mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Local health officials have, for their part, taken umbrage at the suggestion 
that mosquitoes are running wild in their part of the city. They retort that 
the abatement district is attempting to justify its mosquito grab with 
error-strewn allegations that the city's equipment, pesticides and vigilance 
are inferior. 
</P>
<P>
The district has long wanted to bring Long Beach under one anti-mosquito 
umbrella -- its own. Formed in 1952, the regional district assumed 
responsibility for what was then unincorporated county land in the Long Beach 
area. When the city annexed the land, the district retained mosquito 
jurisdiction, leaving Long Beach divided as far as mosquitoes were concerned. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Communities Served 
</P>
<P>
What's more, the city of Signal Hill, surrounded by Long Beach, is in the 
district, as are the cities to the north of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We do a very extensive and thorough job of mosquito control," Jack Hazelrigg, 
the district's assistant manager and entomologist, said. While the city "does a 
good job," Hazelrigg added, "we can do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
The district's sole purpose in life is to keep mosquitoes in check, Hazelrigg 
stressed. It does that in 32 cities in Los Angeles County, along with 
unincorporated parts of the county. 
</P>
<P>
Diana M. Bonta, recently appointed director of the Long Beach Department of 
Health and Human Services, says she has no vested interest in guarding the 
city's mosquito turf. Nonetheless, she says she was disheartened at some of the 
district's contentions and feels compelled to correct them. 
</P>
<P>
She also points out that it would cost residents slightly more if they switched 
to the district, and she argues that a local, rather than a regional agency, is 
more likely to be responsive to residents' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
The arbiter of the matter, the City Council, has referred the district's 
annexation request to its Public Safety Committee, which is holding hearings on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Undecided on Changes 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I haven't found the city to be wanting," Councilman Ray Grabinski, 
the committee's chairman, said. Grabinski, whose West Long Beach district falls 
under the city's jurisdiction, hastened to add that he had not decided whether 
any changes were in order. 
</P>
<P>
The move to bring all of Long Beach into the district was bolstered last summer 
when West Long Beach residents were tormented by swarms of midges, gnat-like, 
flying insects that do not bite, but do bother people. "You didn't want to open 
your mouth to breathe," said Dan Cangro of the Wrigley Assn., a neighborhood 
group that complained to the council that the city's bug-control efforts were 
not all they might be. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always been our contention that if we were under the mosquito (district) 
program, we wouldn't have these problems. . . . The city has been pretty good, 
but it's been on a case-by-case basis," he said, arguing that the health 
department has neither the time nor the staff to devote as much attention to 
mosquito control as does the district. 
</P>
<P>
Bonta, pointing out that midges are largely the responsibility of county flood 
control authorities, says residents are mistaken if they think the district 
will eliminate the midge nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
The district is funded with annual property tax assessments of a couple of 
dollars on every parcel within the district. It would therefore not cost the 
city anything to relinquish its mosquito duties to the district. 
</P>
<P>
But Councilman Evan Anderson Braude, also on the Public Safety Committee, 
argues that however small the fee, it will cost residents something. "I'm not 
particularly receptive to turning it over to the abatement district," said 
Braude, whose shoreline district is within the health department's territory. 
He, too, says he is satisfied with the department's mosquito performance, 
although he agrees that a case can be made for consolidating mosquito control 
efforts in the city. 
</P>
<P>
It costs the health department about $24,000 a year to run its mosquito 
program, a sum that would likely be spent on some other city expense were it 
not used on mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Public Safety Committee last month, Bonta complained that 
much of the district's information about the city's program "is simply 
incorrect." For instance, she said that contrary to the district's assertions, 
the department routinely sprays mosquito breeding areas and also uses 
biological controls, such as mosquito fish, which consume mosquito larvae. 
</P>
<P>
Bonta further argues that since it is necessary for her department to monitor 
mosquito-borne diseases, the city should continue to wage some of Long Beach's 
mosquito battles. It might even make sense to have the city take over the third 
of Long Beach now treated by the district, she said, adding that the costs of 
that move are being researched.
