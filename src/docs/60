SANTA FE SPRINGS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the dust from the Whittier Narrows earthquake on Oct. 1, 1987, finally 
settled, city officials began hearing from concerned business owners. 
</P>
<P>
The earthquake knocked out telephone service, preventing the city's 3,500 
businesses from reporting emergencies such as fires and medical problems. The 
nearly 80,000 workers who commute to Santa Fe Springs daily clogged streets for 
hours. At one point it took nearly 2 hours for a city fire truck to travel 
about 3 miles from the fire station to City Hall, said Fire Chief Robert 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
"Communications were terrible," Wilson said. "We were overwhelmed. We really 
had no idea what was going on in the city." 
</P>
<P>
The safety and satisfaction of the business community is especially important 
in Santa Fe Springs, where 85% of the land is zoned for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
"In the daytime, we could have major problems just dealing with the numbers of 
people" who work here, said Assistant City Manager Fred Latham. "And if this 
were to occur at night, we could have unoccupied buildings with substantial 
damage and not be aware of it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Partnership Formed 
</P>
<P>
As a result of these concerns, the public and private sectors in Santa Fe 
Springs have formed a partnership to design an emergency-preparedness plan that 
would reduce the burden on city government in the three days after a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce suggested that businesses establish 
their own emergency communications network. City officials agreed, and in the 
past year the chamber's suggestion has evolved into an elaborate plan. Though 
supervised by the city, businesses will turn to one another instead of the city 
when disaster strikes. 
</P>
<P>
With just 15,000 residents concentrated in a 2-square-mile area, the best 
option for Santa Fe Springs is to rely on businesses in the other seven square 
miles of town to provide their own emergency support, said Tony Ferrara, a 
supervisor at the California Specialized Training Institute. The institute is a 
division of the state Office of Emergency Services which is helping a committee 
of city and chamber officials prepare the plan. 
</P>
<P>
"The city told the businesses, 'We don't have the traditional support systems. 
So you are it,' " Ferrara said. "This was a tremendous buy-in on the part of 
industry . . . and the city was willing to depart from the norm as far as their 
association with the private sector. What they are doing is making use of what 
they have, and what they have is industry." 
</P>
<P>
If an earthquake were to happen once the city's plan is in place, this is how 
businesses would respond: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Command Posts 
</P>
<P>
They would immediately report to one of four command posts, where an area 
coordinator would report any emergencies to city officials by radio. Workers on 
foot or riding bicycles would check neighboring businesses for injured 
employees or other problems. 
</P>
<P>
Once damages are assessed, workers would turn to a handbook to see where 
emergency supplies are available. Under the cooperative plan, a food warehouse 
might agree to donate food and another firm might provide blankets or plywood 
for boarding up broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking businesses to go beyond their own walls and hold hands," Latham 
said. "It's really exciting." 
</P>
<P>
Once post-disaster emergencies have been taken care of, the plan calls for 
businesses to resume operations quickly. For example, a business using propane 
might not be able to reach a supplier in Los Angeles, so the plan would include 
a list of propane suppliers in the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
"An important element is getting the businesses running again," Wilson said. 
"They're producing resources that can be used for the recovery effort." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disaster Assistance 
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for familiarizing business owners with government disaster 
assistance loans and grants. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Landis, president of the Santa Fe Springs Chamber of Commerce, said the 
plan has met with an enthusiastic reception from the business community. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of resources in this city, and most businesses are willing to 
share them," Landis said. "We're going to wind up with a business community 
that is really well prepared. . . . We feel we are on the cutting edge of 
emergency preparedness." 
</P>
<P>
It will be about three years before the system is completely in place, Latham 
said. Next month, the chamber plans to mail questionnaires to all Santa Fe 
Springs businesses, requesting their participation and outlining information 
about operating hours, existing emergency plans and other relevant facts, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1989, organizers plan to have the handbook distributed and 
command posts set up. In 1990, they plan to complete training in disaster loan 
procedures, first aid and other emergency measures. Santa Fe Springs will 
assign one Fire Department employee to supervise the effort, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The City Council, impressed by the efforts of the business community, has asked 
city staff to develop a similar emergency response system for residential 
areas, Latham said. 
</P>
<P>
Ferrara hopes that Santa Fe Springs' business network can become a model for 
other cities and counties with large industrial bases. 
</P>
<P>
"The concept is that over a period of time, there will be a network of 
communication and support," Latham said, "so when an emergency does occur, the 
relationships will automatically be in place."
