Why read "Tungsten," a partisan novel written almost 60 years ago in which evil 
is unmitigated, virtue unblemished, and the characters seem to lack dimension 
or complexity as they play out their predetermined roles on the stage of the 
class struggle? Why read a book in which ideology reigns supreme, and why 
celebrate its first, belated translation into English? Because the author is 
Cesar Vallejo, one of the great poets of the 20th Century and a major figure in 
Latin American literature. 
</P>
<P>
Vallejo created a wrenching poetic language for Spanish that radically altered 
the shape of its imagery and the nature of its rhythms. No facile trend setter, 
Vallejo forged a new discourse in order to express his own visceral compassion 
for human suffering. He saw the world in piercing flashes of outrage and 
anguish, terror and pity, and what he saw wounded him like knife thrusts. A 
passionate, tragic poet, he mourned our loss of moral innocence and despaired 
of the injustice that moves the world. In the late 1920s, when he was living in 
Paris and eking out a meager livelihood as a journalist, the pain at the roots 
of his being found objective substantiation in radical politics.

Born in the Peruvian Andes in 1892, he witnessed firsthand the victimization 
and exploitation of the South American Indians. Although his own family was not 
financially destitute (his father was a notary and minor bureaucrat in the 
small town of Santiago de Chuco), Vallejo was a cholo, a person born of mixed 
European and Indian ancestry. The fact is not irrelevant. In a society where 
social and economic status followed the color line with cosmic certainty, where 
racial discrimination was rigidly adhered to although rarely acknowledged in 
public, the representatives of foreign companies, with the wholehearted 
complicity of domestic colleagues, extracted high profits from the near-slavery 
of the illiterate, utterly alienated and ultimately helpless victims of that 
racism. Vallejo had ample opportunity to witness the brutalization en masse of 
the Indian underclass and the appalling greed of their lighter-skinned masters 
who carried on the colonial tradition of using Indians as forced labor in mines 
and on plantations. 
</P>
<P>
Twentieth-Century writers from Ciro Alegria to Manuel Scorza have denounced the 
Peruvian tragedy in their books. "Tungsten" was one of the earliest novels to 
do so in modern terms. As a young man, however, Vallejo's greatest energies 
were devoted to writing and publishing his poems ("Los heraldos negros," his 
first book, appeared in 1918); consequently, he remained on the periphery of 
the windstorms of political and social unrest that swept through South America 
in the second decade of the century, although he was in the time and place 
where growing agitation to establish justice for Peruvian Indians and workers 
began its inexorable march toward Marxism. 
</P>

Vallejo, Jose Carlos Mariategui (the "Shining Path" in today's Peru takes its 
name from his writings) and Victor Raul Haya de la Torre (a founder of the 
important APRA movement -- the "Popular Revolutionary American Alliance") 
crossed paths at the university in Trujillo. But Vallejo was an intermittent 
student. His family began to experience economic difficulties during his 
adolescence, and he was obliged to interrupt secondary school and then his 
university studies to take a series of jobs, which included office work in the 
mines at Tambores and Quiruvilca, and on a large sugar plantation in the 
Chicama Valley. 
</P>
<P>
These facts are not irrelevant either. They provided the historical raw 
material for "Tungsten," the documented background to Vallejo's outcry against 
the grim realities of Indian life in Peru. The shape that material would take 
-- his conviction that the problem of race was indistinguishable from the 
problem of class -- was determined by his increasingly active commitment to 
socialism, a political engagement that, by 1930, led to his expulsion from 
France, where he had gone to live seven years earlier.

The action of the novel is centered in a fictional mining town and its 
provincial capital, Colca. The time is 1917, just before the U.S. entry into 
World War I when a ready supply of tungsten would be crucial to the weapons 
industry. A North American corporation takes over the mine, and the boom is on: 
Peasants are first lured and then coerced into working for the company, local 
Indians, the Soras, are cheated of their land and animals, petit bourgeois 
entrepreneurs scramble on the backs of the poor for wealth and position, and 
venal officials and dignitaries find a new source of bribery and 
power-brokering in the foreign capitalists. The first two-thirds of the book, 
in fact, constitutes a genre study of unashamed thuggery, a series of vignettes 
of corruption, repression and brutality that sets the stage for the violent 
heart of "Tungsten" and the appearance of its proletarian Indian hero, Servando 
Huanca. 
</P>

Two Indian boys are forcibly conscripted into military service (the military as 
well as the mining contractors have "body quotas" -- numbers of recruits or 
workers that must be obtained by any means), and on the long march from their 
homes to Colca, when they are tied by the waist to the mules that their captors 
ride, they are so badly abused that one of them eventually dies. Outside the 
Subprefecture an angry crowd gathers, indignant at the visible signs of the 
conscripts' mistreatment. One defiant man, Servando Huanca, steps forward to 
speak for the crowd with natural authority and an instinctive class 
consciousness. These qualities inspire the people and momentarily cow the 
authorities, but then the troops are ordered to fire into the crowd, and later 
that night officially sanctioned vigilantes pursue any Indian they can find, 
shooting to kill. Some, however, are taken into custody, and deals are struck 
by sleazy officials which allow the prisoners to be sent off to a sure death in 
the mines to help fulfill the company's "body quota." 
</P>
<P>
Last and certainly least, the third section of the book is a kind of postscript 
to the Colca massacre. Vallejo allows his indignation and passion to turn into 
mechanical ideology: Servando Huanca "duckspeaks" a mercifully brief exercise 
in orthodoxy, proclaiming that world revolution is under way, that it will be 
led by a militant proletariat inspired by Lenin and not by bourgeois 
"intellectuals," that it will sweep away the ruling classes in Peru. Vallejo 
even permits the novel to end with this ponderously symbolic sentence: 
"Outside, the wind was rising, portending storm." 
</P>
<P>
Kevin J. O'Connor has written a thoughtful and informative foreword, Robert 
Mezey has done a fine job of translating Vallejo's often quirky Spanish, and 
both of them deserve our gratitude for their sensitivity and skill in bringing 
the work to the attention of an English-language audience. I am sorry that I 
cannot say as much for the editing. The typographical errors are frequent and 
unforgivable, and there is no indication as one reads that Mezey has provided 
important end notes to the text. This is a disservice to the reader; Vallejo 
and his translator deserve better.
