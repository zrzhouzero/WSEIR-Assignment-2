</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The expulsion of a radical slum priest from his ecclesiastic order has silenced 
Haiti's most influential voice for the rights of the nation's poor. 
</P>
<P>
In expelling Father Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the conservative Salesian Order 
accused the populist Roman Catholic cleric of fomenting class warfare, calling 
him a "protagonist of destabilization." 
</P>
<P>
His ouster was announced Dec. 15 in a statement from Rome. Although Aristide 
remains a priest, he cannot officiate at Mass or deliver sermons over church 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
"He has been neutralized," said sociologist Franklyn Midi. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Outspoken Campaigner 
</P>
<P>
Aristide, 35, a Salesian priest since 1975, has been one of the most outspoken 
campaigners for social justice in a country ruled for nearly its entire 
184-year existence by dictators. 
</P>
<P>
He has escaped at least three attempts on his life, including a Sept. 11 attack 
at his St. Jean Bosco Church in a Port-au-Prince slum in which thugs armed with 
machetes, guns, clubs and spears killed 12 people and wounded at least 70 
others. 
</P>
<P>
One week later, rank-and-file soldiers overthrew Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in a 
coup that put Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril in power. Coup leaders said they wanted 
democratic reforms and an end to state-sponsored violence, citing the church 
massacre as an example. 
</P>
<P>
Salesian officials expelled Aristide after he failed to obey their order to 
leave Haiti by Oct. 17 and assume a new post in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Popular Protests 
</P>
<P>
Two previous transfer orders were rescinded because of popular protests. 
Thousands protested in support of Aristide for several days in October, but 
there were no immediate demonstrations after the expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
Aristide, who has been seen in public only once since the church massacre, has 
made no public statement and has declined requests for interviews. But friends 
say his morale is excellent and he might appeal the church decision. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its condemnation of military brutality and human-rights abuses in 
Haiti, the Catholic hierarchy has long opposed Aristide's political 
proselytizing of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
A proponent of liberation theology, which advocates church involvement in a 
political struggle by the poor against social injustice, Aristide preaches 
"active nonviolence." He urges a "real revolution" to bring democracy to Haiti, 
but does not specifically propose an armed uprising. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fire and Brimstone 
</P>
<P>
His pulpit style is that of a fire-and-brimstone preacher whose leading 
questions prompt quick responses from the congregation. The sermons were 
broadcast nationwide and earned Aristide a huge following among the urban poor 
and the rural peasantry, who call the bespectacled ascetic their "prophet." 
</P>
<P>
Although civic leaders and many priests applauded Aristide's crusade, the 
church hierarchy apparently feared the possible consequences of radicalizing 
the masses. 
</P>
<P>
"The upper and middle classes, of course, have heaved a sigh of relief," Midi 
said of Aristide's ouster. "They are uncomfortable when the voice of the poor 
is raised too high." 
</P>
<P>
"What they have not understood is that Aristide has contained the resentment of 
the impoverished masses by giving it a religious form," Midi added. "He has not 
sent them into the streets but drawn them into the church." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bishops Were Worried 
</P>
<P>
A Salesian spokesman in Rome, Father Joseph Aubrey, told the Voice of America 
that the expulsion was ordered because Haitian "bishops worried about the 
results of Aristide's action." 
</P>
<P>
But Father Serge Miot, secretary of Haitian Bishops Council, denied that the 
council had asked the Salesians to expel Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
The effective silencing of Aristide coincides with a move by Avril to tighten 
army discipline after a purported Oct. 14 coup attempt. Since then, the 
government has imprisoned or discharged dozens of soldiers for alleged 
insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
Leftist politicians have accused the government of clamping down on the most 
progressive element in the army -- soldiers angered by the slow progress in 
bringing about the democratic reforms Avril promised when he became president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Had Become a Symbol 
</P>
<P>
It is not known what role, if any, the government had in Aristide's ouster; but 
to some, the priest has become a symbol of the democratic struggle. 
</P>
<P>
"Aristide was discharged from his religious order in the same way that soldiers 
faithful to the Sept. 17 reform movement have been discharged from the army," 
said Paul Dejean, a Haitian author and social worker, referring to those who 
participated in the coup to gain democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
"People who believe in the Gospel values of liberation, liberty and justice are 
penalized and punished," he said.
