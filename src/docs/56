Toni Taylor's article, "Agents Take a Beating" (Dec. 11), was the nicest thing 
that could have been written about the lonely life of a travel agent and the 
sometimes abuse we get from the travel industry whose livelihood really depends 
on us. I entered the travel field 41 years ago, and lots of changes have taken 
place in that time. But never have I read an article that was so concise and 
informative about the travel agent.

Thank you for printing it. Please thank Toni Taylor for writing it. Also, 
thanks for providing your readers with an informative travel section. Without 
it, the public and travel agent would not be as well informed as we are now.
