Congratulations to Times staff writer Doug Smith and The Times for the 
heartwarming and inspirational story about Kenneth and Jolene Hodder, newly 
commissioned Salvation Army officers (Metro, Dec. 24). 
</P>
<P>
How fortunate we are to be blessed with such unselfish and committed young 
people in our efforts to cope with the myriad problems that beset our society 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Faith in our way of life should be immensely strengthened in knowing that 
people like Kenneth and Jolene Hodder will be leading the charge for a better 
tomorrow.
