When caterer David Zafferelli joined the throngs at Nordstrom's new downtown 
San Francisco store in October, he dropped $150 on two flannel shirts and 
another $150 for bubbly and Beluga caviar at the store's Champagne Exchange 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
"We just thought that was as much fun as shopping," he said. "I'll always go 
for any excuse to drink champagne and eat caviar." 
</P>
<P>
Increasingly, shoppers who stop to nosh at department stores are finding chic, 
newfangled eateries in place of the proper tearooms and restaurants of their 
childhoods. Whereas patrons in the early part of the century sipped tea and 
nibbled cucumber sandwiches, customers of upscale department stores today are 
more likely to have espresso and cookies or Cornish game hen and Chardonnay or 
mesquite-grilled chicken and pasta salad. 
</P>
<P>
The shifts in department store food service reflect a fundamental change in the 
philosophy of shoppers, observers say. In the old days, people would make 
shopping an all-day event, with a leisurely lunch or tea break built in. Today, 
with time-starved but hard-working baby boomers hankering for service and 
quality, the right restaurant can serve not only as a lure but also as an 
incentive to linger in the store. And shoppers such as Zafferelli have proved 
willing to spend liberally for the ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, old-fashioned tearooms still exist, and some, such as those at 
Bullocks Wilshire and Bullock's Pasadena, are thriving, particularly at holiday 
time. But many stores in recent years have turned these genteel anachronisms 
into stylish cafes or bistros where customers come year-round just to dine, 
never mind the shopping. 
</P>
<P>
"The '80s has brought us into a whole different era," said Robert J. Nyman, 
president of George Lang Corp., a New York firm that develops restaurant 
concepts. "Most stores today are using food service as an amenity that has to 
do with the total marketing of the store." 
</P>
<P>
With department stores undergoing sweeping changes of late, many retailers, 
particularly downtown merchants that must compete with ubiquitous suburban 
malls, have strived to hold onto or devise unique operations that make them a 
destination. Restaurants often fill the bill, even if they don't contribute 
heartily to the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
At the new Nordstrom in San Francisco, for example, the marble-topped champagne 
bar has become a draw for upscale customers, as has an authentic English pub 
modeled on one at Harrods in London. At the flagship Bloomingdale's in 
Manhattan, the premier dining spot among half a dozen eateries is Le Train 
Bleu, a re-creation of a luxury Orient Express-type dining car. The Dayton 
Hudson department stores in the Midwest are expanding a Marketplace Foods 
concept that offers carry-out pasta, stir-fried dishes, freshly baked breads 
and frozen yogurt to busy downtown workers. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike their tearoom predecessors, which usually were situated in a store's 
highest reaches, these food outlets are often stashed next to fashion 
departments. And they are a far cry from the Formica-topped counters prevalent 
at five-and-dime and discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
"The opportunities for food in department stores are the best they've been in 
over 20 years," said John D. Lovelace, central director of food services for 
Dayton Hudson in Minneapolis. "People eat every day, but they don't shop every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
Food service has gone in and out of favor with retailers over the last few 
decades, and even today retailers' philosophies differ widely. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a very mixed bag," said Charles J. Leven, senior vice president, 
director of operations at Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. "Some companies are 
cutting back, a few are expanding." Saks intends to open its first restaurant 
at the flagship Manhattan store next year, Leven said, after customers clamored 
for food service. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Quick Food' Concepts 
</P>
<P>
Until about 1950, large department stores catering to the carriage trade 
typically used a chunk of their space for tearooms. In the 1960s, the 
popularity of such rooms declined, and many started losing money. As real 
estate became more valuable in the 1970s, merchants began devoting the space to 
clothing and other items that were more profitable. At the same time, many 
stores were going into suburban malls that had abundant sit-down restaurants or 
fast-food outlets in so-called food courts. 
</P>
<P>
Then women went to work in record numbers and the population became more health 
and diet conscious. Fewer people had the time or inclination to spend a 
leisurely afternoon at their favorite tearoom. That gave rise to a variety of 
"quick food" concepts in stores catering to customers for whom money was less 
of an object than convenience and quality. 
</P>
<P>
Nordstrom plunged into the food business 10 years ago after having leased space 
for years to a small chain of restaurants. It now has 70 food outlets in 58 
stores, most under the names Espresso Bar and Cafe Express, featuring fresh 
soups and salads. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with having to attract shoppers to a seedy location three blocks from 
Union Square in San Francisco, Nordstrom decided to go in for some culinary 
theatrics in its newest store. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to create little pockets of fun," said Jim Dickinson, general 
manager of the Seattle-based chain's restaurant division. "We also wanted to 
create a reason for people to stay in our stores rather than get out to our 
competitors." 
</P>
<P>
The Pub, strategically placed next to the men's department, is modeled on the 
Green Man at Harrods in London, an innovative retailer that houses about 20 
food outlets and a massive food hall where Londoners and tourists alike buy 
pricey groceries. The Nordstrom room features stools covered with forest green 
leather, a plank floor made of Kentucky barn wood, a healthy selection of 
imported and domestic beers and television monitors. 
</P>
<P>
If the Pub idea proves successful, Dickinson said, Nordstrom plans to expand it 
into other new stores nationwide. The chain also is considering a "bread basket 
concept" that would sell freshly baked goods and small open-face sandwiches, 
already dubbed Nordwiches. 
</P>
<P>
The store's Champagne Exchange was designed to offer a high return. It takes up 
less space by far than would a traditional tearoom yet affords a high markup on 
its caviar and 103 champagne varieties. The concept "enables the customer to 
spend a lot of money," Dickinson said. "We do find, particularly in San 
Francisco, it doesn't bother people to be drinking a $9 glass of champagne." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lots of Flash 
</P>
<P>
The chain also this holiday rolled out its Nordstrom Select Pantry, a selection 
of gift food items developed in its restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, Dickinson said, Nordstrom's restaurant operations account for 1.5% of 
the chain's annual sales (which last year totaled nearly $2 billion) yet 22% of 
its transactions, indicating that food tabs are generally far lower than those 
for other purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Bloomingdale's flagship store in New York also goes in for selling sizzle along 
with its steaks. "The restaurants at Bloomingdale's have evolved into unique 
concepts in tune with the eating public," said Will Hellemeyer, director of 
food service. "We are what people expect of restaurants in the '80s . . . and 
not what they expect to find in a department store restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
After renovating the housewares department several years ago, the store was 
left with a long, narrow space on an intermediate level between two floors. A 
store designer came up with the idea of copying a luxury dining car, complete 
with green velvet chairs, white linen tablecloths and brass chandeliers. 
</P>
<P>
Le Train Bleu (named for a midnight blue engine), which opened in 1978, is "a 
Continental restaurant that competes with restaurants on the East Side of 
Manhattan and is rated in dining guides," Hellemeyer said. With seating for 64, 
the restaurant features such specialties as calf's liver with cassis and 
shallots, grilled Cornish game hen stuffed with foie gras and wild rice and 
grilled swordfish with sun-dried tomato butter. Average tab: $20. 
</P>
<P>
Among other Bloomie's food service operations, Hellemeyer said, are Forty 
Carrots, a "healthy food" restaurant in which the store years ago introduced 
frozen yogurt to the New York market; Showtime Cafe, an upscale cafeteria 
similar to Cafe Casino, and Espresso Bar, "a Euro-chic Italian cafe" offering 
desserts, fresh pastas, salads and wines. 
</P>
<P>
The decision whether to offer food service is usually based on a store's 
location and bottom line. Store officials would not talk about their 
restaurants' financial results, but they acknowledged that food service is an 
expensive proposition. 
</P>
<P>
The food business "in general has lower margins than most other merchandise in 
a department store," said Ken Stevens, a consultant with the Los Angeles office 
of McKinsey &amp; Co. It comes down to a trade-off, with the retailer 
determining whether the intangible benefits of offering the service outweigh 
the reduced profitability. 
</P>
<P>
At Marshall Field's in Chicago, for instance, the legendary Walnut Room -- a 
restaurant in the old tradition -- is not considered a big profit maker "other 
than that it's a big draw," said Homer G. Sharp, head of central display. 
"Obviously, people go shopping while they're here." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Some End Food Service 
</P>
<P>
With a typical sit-down eatery costing between $500,000 and $1 million to 
install, many retailers, May Co. California among them, are inclined to put 
restaurants into free-standing stores but not into those mall locations served 
by a food court. Another consideration is space: New department stores tend to 
be far smaller than the huge stores of years past and have less space to spare 
for low-return businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Bonwit Teller, a fashion specialty store, has phased out its food business. 
Until its purchase by May Department Stores two years ago, Robinson's was 
making a big push into food service. Now, it has only three food outlets 
chain-wide, all of them leased. 
</P>
<P>
In designing its newest stores, including those in Los Angeles and Palm Desert, 
Bullock's left out restaurants. And when the chain remodeled its Santa Ana 
location, the restaurant was removed. 
</P>
<P>
The tearoom in Bullock's Pasadena, according to James B. Brooks, the store's 
general manager, is the chain's most profitable food service operation and 
lately has been expanding its successful banquet business. Even so, the tearoom 
recently eliminated its evening food service, primarily because of increased 
restaurant competition in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest proponents of food is Dayton Hudson Department Store Co., 
which claims to have the largest upscale food service among U.S. department 
stores, serving 12 million patrons a year. 
</P>
<P>
When Lovelace, the food service director, joined the company in 1982, he 
immediately set about developing new "upscale fast-food" concepts and 
transforming the company's traditional sit-down restaurants "to meet the needs 
of the customer of the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Among other operations, the company came up with Yogurt Express, which 
generates a hefty $1,000 in sales per square foot (compared to about $200 for 
non-food merchandise) and is being rolled out to several of the company's 37 
stores; 700 Express, designed to serve customers quality fast food within 10 
minutes, and a combination of five quick food concepts that replaced the 
flagship Minneapolis store's traditional Sky Room and quickly tripled sales. 
The company is also expanding its 4-year-old Marketplace Foods, similar to 
Macy's Cellar in New York, with a substantial carry-out area. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting customers' rapidly changing palates, ethnic foods are playing a 
bigger role in Dayton Hudson's offerings. Forget the cling peach halves, 
cottage cheese and iceberg lettuce leaves of yore. New menus offer Morocco 
salad, made with boneless chicken breast and couscous ($6), and smoked salmon 
with radicchio, bibb lettuce, avocado, grapefruit, chopped egg and caviar, 
Dayton Hudson's most expensive salad at $7. 
</P>
<P>
The Broadway, too, has found that its customers' changing tastes have forced it 
to adapt quickly to new trends. It recently closed a traditional sit-down 
restaurant at its Brea Mall store in favor of a deli service with lighter fare. 
"We . . . have seen a really remarkable response," said Richard F. Clayton, 
president. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Food Is Fashion' 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Bullock's, the Broadway has put food service operations into its newest 
stores, but it also recently closed restaurants in Beverly Center and Baldwin 
Hills where it "couldn't come up with a formula that worked," Clayton said. The 
43-store chain now operates 24 food facilities, serving more than 2 million 
diners a year. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a lot of transactions," Clayton said. "It's important because we touch 
a lot of customers." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, food service, once the province of large department stores, has also 
spread to smaller specialty apparel boutiques such as Koala Blue, with its 
Australian-style milk bars; Fred Segal, which has restaurants at stores in 
Santa Monica and on Melrose Avenue; Merry Go Round, a chain selling young men's 
and women's apparel that is testing a '50s-style diner and soda fountain in a 
store in Denver, and Barneys, an exclusive women's clothier in Manhattan that 
has Le Cafe, a buffet and bistro bar with about 90 seats. 
</P>
<P>
To Dickinson of Nordstrom, the merging of menus and merchandise makes sense. 
"We consider ourselves a fashion retail store, and we believe food is fashion," 
he said. "There is tremendous opportunity for good dining."
