That low-slung, wooden couch with cushions covered in Mexican serapes is not 
cheesy: It's Monterey, Jack. 
</P>
<P>
What? You don't remember the style of furniture that filled working-class Los 
Angeles ranch houses in the 1930s and '40s, spread East with the lore of 
Westerns, then met an inglorious end in the rumpus room? 
</P>
<P>
Don't blame Don Shorts and Dolores Fisher. The proprietors of a Ventura 
antiques shop, they take credit for rekindling interest in Monterey furniture, 
which is decorated with wrought-iron hinges, hand-painted donkeys, flowers and 
sombrero-bedecked figures. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to be considered the pioneers in bringing this thing back to light," 
explained Shorts, 54, who co-owns the Old California Store on East Thompson 
Boulevard with Fisher, 55. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Cowboy Style 
</P>
<P>
Others may have received more publicity for selling the factory-made furniture 
that Ojai collector Bob Smith describes as "a motion-picture version of what 
cowboys might have had in the way of furniture -- if they had furniture." 
</P>
<P>
But none of the handful of Monterey dealers has done more to research and 
promote a style whose history was little known 6 months ago, the couple's 
colleagues agree. 
</P>
<P>
"I would certainly give the most credit for the resurrection to Don and Dee," 
said Jack Moore, a Pasadena antiques dealer who for 7 years has traded in the 
furniture that combines early California, Mexican and Western influences. 
</P>
<P>
Shorts and Fisher have turned their 1926 home, which doubles as living quarters 
and a showroom, into a Monterey monument, with a rotating selection of dining 
room sets, bedroom sets, living room groupings, Mexican kitsch and at least 
three photographs of Will Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
They also publish a newsletter on the furniture, serve as hosts at "openings" 
in the homes of clients, and organize outings to such shrines of Monterey 
furniture as Rogers' 1921 ranch house in Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
The couple even organized a museum exhibition last summer of the ersatz cowboy 
furniture. "Monterey: An Exhibition of California Rancho Furniture, Pottery and 
Art" filled one story and part of a second at the Santa Monica Heritage Museum. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Introduction 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition enhanced the furniture's status as a collectible by popularizing 
it, antiques dealers say. It also introduced the style to Kenneth Trapp, a 
curator of decorative arts at the Oakland Museum. Now he plans to include it in 
an upcoming exhibition of California Craftsman furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"It struck me as wonderfully ludicrous," Trapp said. 
</P>
<P>
And so it is. Consider the chaise lounge done up frontier-style, with a canvas 
canopy to complete the covered-wagon look. Or the grand piano fashioned out of 
wood so rough-hewn that it looks as if it had been dragged through a mountain 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
In the last 2 years, the Westward-ho look has become Westward-haute. Magazines 
such as Metropolitan Home and Better Homes and Gardens have praised Monterey 
furniture, tony Los Angeles shops have taken to selling it, and one shop even 
peddles modern-day reproductions of it. 
</P>
<P>
The limelight also has fallen on the designer of the Monterey line, George 
Mason, an 81-year-old retiree now living in San Luis Obispo. Instead of making 
couches and chairs, these days Mason occupies himself with painting, and lately 
his favorite subject has been his own rediscovered furniture. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paintings Exhibited 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in December, Shorts and Fisher mounted an exhibition of the folksy 
paintings at their store. Mason's painted renditions of Monterey furniture sold 
briskly for as much as $185 apiece, while about 50 collectors competed for his 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
"I came down from Pismo Beach just to shake his hand," gushed Patricia Slater, 
53, a designer of what she described as "cowboy punk" furniture. 
</P>
<P>
It almost seemed like the good old days to Mason, whose father ran the Los 
Angeles factory where his designs were made. In 1929, executives of Barker 
Brothers Furniture asked the pair to design and manufacture a line that would 
bear the Monterey name and would suit the ranch houses springing up all over 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The Masons were told to take their cue from a settee that appeared in the 
background of a Warner Brothers movie, "Old Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
Made from Oregon alder, stained in six colors and shaped into about 120 pieces, 
each quirkier than the last one, the furniture was a hit, as were a host of 
copycat lines: La Fiesta, Coronado, Ranch-O. 
</P>
<P>
Monterey-style furniture spread to homes in Texas, New York, Chicago and 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Changing Times 
</P>
<P>
In 1943, Mason was drafted; his father died, and Monterey came to a grinding 
halt. After the war, tastes changed. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone threw it out and got chrome and glass," said Betty Gold, who stocked 
her much-publicized Melrose Avenue furniture shop, Territory, with Monterey 
purchased from Shorts and Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
The distinctive furniture became, as one collector says, "grist for garage 
sales." 
</P>
<P>
Enter Shorts, who 10 years ago quit his job as a high school history teacher in 
Santa Barbara to devote himself full-time to his hobby of collecting old 
paintings and furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
The homemade crafts and pottery that sold at roadside stands throughout 
Southern California in the 1930s had begun to attract his attention. Typically 
decorated with sombrero-topped men either asleep beneath cactuses or leading 
stubborn mules, they reminded him of his South Gate childhood. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a '30s Southern California child and have never outgrown it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Shorts discovered Monterey furniture and liked how well it matched the 
knickknacks he was acquiring. 
</P>
<P>
He bought the furniture first for himself, because he did not think it would 
sell. In fact, it was not until 2 years ago that the shop began to deal 
exclusively in Monterey-style furniture and its trappings. Since then, sales 
have tripled, he said, and he delves into a network of thrift shops and 
secondhand stores to replenish his stock. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Shorts was not sure until recently what he was selling. He 
had noticed that the pieces were all branded with the same label -- "Monterey" 
-- but unraveling their origins proved difficult. 
</P>
<P>
One person told him that the furniture came from Monterrey, Mexico. No, another 
said, Monterey, Calif. But a Monterey, Calif., antiques dealer put that notion 
to rest. "Oh, that's what we call Carmel furniture," she told him. 
</P>
<P>
It was not until a friend found an old Barker Brothers catalogue that Shorts 
had a tangible lead. Lacking details, however, Shorts wrongly concluded that 
the company had manufactured the furniture, not merely sold it. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Error Noted 
</P>
<P>
Mason, the furniture's real manufacturer, noted the error when he read an 
article about the Santa Monica exhibition. "It made me so angry," remembers 
Mason, who complained to the museum's director, Tobi Smith. She was only too 
happy to hear from him. 
</P>
<P>
Smith enlisted both Mason and Shorts to write chapters in an upcoming catalogue 
of the exhibition, which will include an essay by Smith's husband, Bob, the 
Ojai collector, who also teaches furniture design at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
Titled "My Mexicana Nirvana," Bob Smith's piece hails the furniture as "a 
unique manifestation of Western urban culture." 
</P>
<P>
"Woven with mythology, fantasy, eclecticism and pretension, Monterey furniture 
is synonymous with Southern Californians' collective search for a meaningful 
identity -- a population with no heritage and little in common," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Smith believes that modern furniture buyers are attracted to Monterey 
because it tickles the modern fancy. 
</P>
<P>
"As an unabashedly eclectic and nostalgic movement, Postmodernism says it's all 
right to borrow style or fake material if you are honest about it," he said. 
And "Monterey Furniture is honestly fake." 
</P>
<P>
Even honestly fake furniture comes with a price. A dining room set sells for 
$3,500 at the California shop, which is still less expensive than a fine chair 
from the Arts and Crafts Movement but is much more than the $79 Mason remembers 
the same pieces selling for originally. 
</P>
<P>
But for collectors, such as Alan Erenberg, 39, the cost is worth it. He says 
the furniture perfectly fits the hacienda-inspired architecture so prevalent in 
Southern California. A vice president of Serta, the mattress company, he and 
his former wife, Lori, replaced their collection of '50s furnishings with 
Monterey when they bought a 1920s California ranch house. When they recently 
divorced, he said he "got custody" of the furniture, which now decorates his 
Spanish Revival apartment in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
That does not mean, however, that everybody loves Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Gloria List's clients at Nonesuch Gallery in Santa Monica "find it 
garish and klutzy," she said. And even converts can tire of Monterey's quirky 
style. Two of Shorts' best customers, he sadly reports, recently tossed out 
their Monterey collection in favor of crisp, contemporary furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
But Mason is glad that at least some see the world through his eyes. After 
returning from military service, he longed for the Monterey days. First he 
represented another furniture company; then he ran a store that sold Colonial 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
"I was an unhappy guy," he said.
