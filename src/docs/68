The USO has received a city permit to move its administrative offices and 
social club into the restored Masonic Temple on Pine Avenue in downtown Long 
Beach, close to the 16,000 military personnel who live in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the United Service Organizations of Los Angeles say the Pine 
Avenue club will open this spring. It will provide a lounge and game room for 
servicemen. In addition, it will offer a variety of services to military 
families, such as housing and child-care referrals.

<P>
Long Beach, with its sizable military population, is now a much more suitable 
site for the club than Hollywood, USO officials said.
