Anti-terrorist police in London arrested several people in connection with the 
discovery two weeks ago of a major IRA bomb factory in the city. Police would 
not say how many people were rounded up or give further details of the 
operation. One man was arrested earlier after police found an apartment in 
south London full of bomb-making equipment and more than 100 pounds of Semtex 
explosives of the sort used by Irish Republican Army guerrillas fighting to end 
British rule in Northern Ireland. He was charged with conspiracy to cause 
explosions in Britain likely to endanger life.
