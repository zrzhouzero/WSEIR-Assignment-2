More than 500 Tibetan university students defied a ban on demonstations in 
Lhasa and marched to the regional government headquarters calling for a 
"peaceful solution to the Tibetan problem." Tibetan and foreign sources said 
that the demonstrators from Lhasa University encountered no resistance from the 
massive Chinese police force in the capital and that there was no violence. The 
demonstration was in sharp contrast with an anti-Chinese, pro-independence 
rally Dec. 10 in which police fired on unarmed Tibetan Buddhist monks and 
onlookers, killing as many as eight people.
