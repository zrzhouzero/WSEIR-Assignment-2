I find it very disappointing that The Times would refer to someone as 
close-minded and ridiculous as Tracey Ullman as a "tastemaker" (Taste Makers, 
Dec. 25). 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who lives, (and very well I might add!) in this city and feels that 
theater here does not merit her very valuable time has not looked very far. I'm 
sure that Ms. Ullman could find something to satisfy her superior taste. 
</P>
<P>
If she finds Los Angeles and this country in fact to be a cultural or artistic 
desert, then perhaps she should move back to London and have her tea there, or 
would that hit here where it hurts, her pocketbook!
