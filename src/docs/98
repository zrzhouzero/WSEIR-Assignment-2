New Year's Eve party-goers who drink and drive faced a greater chance of 
beginning 1989 in jail as law enforcement officers fanned out in unusually 
heavy numbers Saturday to rid Southern California roadways of drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol, which reported one freeway traffic death blamed 
on a drunk driver late Friday, canceled days off for many officers so they 
could staff an "Operation Impaired Driver" task force in the downtown area New 
Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
The 42-officer unit, double the usual deployment against drunk drivers, 
concentrated on the heavily traveled freeways -- the Santa Monica, Harbor, 
Pasadena, Golden State and Hollywood -- that converge in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll be out there just to look for drunken drivers, to stop them and arrest 
them," CHP Officer Diane Lowery said. "It means that there will also be more 
officers to assist any motorists needing help." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Roadblock in Burbank 
</P>
<P>
The CHP scheduled no New Year's Eve sobriety checkpoints, but at least one 
local law enforcement agency, the Burbank Police Department, planned a 
roadblock to snare drunk drivers beginning about one hour before dark at an 
undisclosed location, Police Lt. Don Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers stopped 800 drivers at a sobriety checkpoint Friday night in 
Baldwin Park, arresting five on suspicion of driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
Police in Los Angeles set up a van that houses their Immediate Booking and 
Release System behind Parker Center police headquarters, where it was to be in 
operation from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic officers throughout the city planned "maximum deployment," utilizing 
all available officers and assigning them specially to look for motorists under 
the influence of alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Agencies Beef Up Patrols 
</P>
<P>
Several law agencies in Orange County also planned beefed-up patrols. In Costa 
Mesa, seven two-officer teams will look for drunk drivers, then put them behind 
bars with the help of specially assigned jail personnel, Police Sgt. Tom Winter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP reported one alcohol-related traffic death about 11 p.m. Friday, six 
hours into the agency's holiday fatality reporting period that ends midnight 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Rene Rodriquez, 21, was booked on suspicion of felony drunk driving and 
vehicular manslaughter after the fiery crash on the Harbor Freeway near El 
Segundo Boulevard in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators said Rodriquez drove his Datsun 280Z onto the freeway at about 
100 m.p.h. When he swerved to avoid other traffic, the car struck the center 
divider and flipped on its side, skidding along the cement divider for 250 
yards as it burst into flames. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Passenger Dies 
</P>
<P>
A passenger, Raul Trevino, 28, of Lawndale, was trapped inside the car and 
killed. Rodriquez escaped with minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP recorded four traffic deaths during the New Year's holiday period last 
year in Los Angeles County. Statewide, 43 people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officers arrested 467 people for suspected drunk driving in Los Angeles 
County last year and made 1,874 arrests statewide.
