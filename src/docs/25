Phyllis Plous admits that six years is a long time to put together any exhibit. 
Her timing seems auspicious, however. When the curator began organizing a show 
of abstract painting in 1982, in her words, the art form was "relegated to the 
dust bins." Today, as "Abstract Options" is about to open, that is all changed. 
</P>
<P>
"There's been a definite acceleration of interest in abstraction since the 
mid-'80s," said Plous, who with Frances Colpitt co-curated the 32-painting 
exhibit, opening Friday at UC Santa Barbara's University Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The project began when Colpitt, a critic and art historian, arrived at UCSB to 
teach, said Plous, University Art Museum curator. "Neo Expressionism was so 
rampant at the time and we began to wonder why we only saw Abstract art in 
artists' studios." 
</P>
<P>
Ten contemporary artists from the east and west coasts are represented in the 
show. The co-curators chose artists that differed in their treatment of surface 
and form, but shared a preference for a lush richness. 
</P>
<P>
"The show perhaps is about sensuality and the process of painting," Plous said. 
"Unlike Neo-Geo, this is not dry illustrative abstraction. I don't like the 
word pretty very much, but I think it's going to be a beautiful show." 
</P>
<P>
Artists in the exhibit are Edith Baumann-Hudson, Moira Dryer, Heidi Gluck, 
Nancy Haynes, James Hayward, Mary Heilmann, Julian Lethbridge, John M. Miller, 
Paul Mogensen and Stephen Westfall. It is scheduled to run in Santa Barbara 
through Feb. 26, then travel to Evanston, Ill., and Santa Clara, Calif.

RETIRING: Artist La Monte Westmoreland, who established Los Angeles' most 
active high school-based gallery, will retire this month to concentrate on his 
own artwork after 10 years as director of Roberts Art Gallery at Santa Monica 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I just need to have more studio time," Westmoreland said, now making mostly 
mixed-media collages shown at Lizardi/Harp Gallery in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Lita Albuquerque, John Swihart, Laddie John Dill, Guy Dill and Sandra Mendelson 
Rubin lead an illustrious list of local artists, many of them alumni of the 
high school, who regularly took part in Westmoreland's exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica-based artist Peter Alexander, who for several years donated works 
for annual auctions to support the gallery, lauded Westmoreland's efforts that 
he said turned the space, founded in 1935, into a unique showcase for local 
emerging and established artists that particularly benefited the high school's 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole deal was La Monte's doing," said Alexander, one of this city's 
best-known painters whose two daughters went to Santa Monica High School. "His 
enthusiasm, in terms of bringing work to the students, has been quite 
extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
Ann Goodwin, a painting instructor at the high school, will succeed 
Westmoreland, whose final exhibit, "Paintings and Sculptures," Jan. 5 through 
Jan. 26, features eight artists. (See art openings for details.)

LACE GRANTS: Local interdisciplinary artists developing new work may apply for 
grants from Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE), now in the fourth year 
of its Grant Program for Interdisciplinary Artists. More than $30,200 are 
available for individuals or groups of artists working collaboratively. For 
information and an application, call LACE at (213) 624-5650. June Scott heads 
up the program. 
</P>
<P>
IN PUBLIC: Public art and its preservation, issues of increasing concern 
nationwide, are the theme of a new publication. "Going Public: A Field Guide to 
Developments in Art in Public Places" was produced with the input of 30 
nationally recognized artists, public art administrators, design professionals 
and others brought together by the National Endowment for the Arts to examine 
public art issues. For information, contact the Arts Education Service at the 
University of Massachusetts, (413) 545-2360.
