FORGOTTEN TRIBES OF LEBANON'S WADI KHALED THRIVE ON SMUGGLING OF GOODS TO SYRIA

WADI KHALED, Lebanon 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trapped in this northern Lebanese valley, a forgotten community living by 
tribal traditions thrives on smuggling goods across the river to Syria. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the affluence this has brought, the Bedouins of Wadi Khaled feel as if 
they are prisoners in their own land, captive because of a historical mishap 
that left them with no citizenship rights. Their status has been "under study" 
since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 years ago, the tribes' fear of officials drove the people to hide 
in the woods. They missed Lebanon's only official census, conducted in 1932 
when the country was still under French mandate. No population count has been 
carried out since, so the status of the residents of Wadi Khaled is still 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
Abu Mustapha, clad in traditional Arab headdress and gray gallabia, or 
ankle-length shirt, said the tribesmen mistook census officials for envoys of 
the Ottoman Empire authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"They hid in the woods because they were afraid their children would be drafted 
into the Ottoman army. They were illiterate people and did not understand that 
we were not under Ottoman rule anymore," said Abu Mustapha. 
</P>
<P>
The Bedouins of Wadi Khaled hold residence permits, issued to all foreigners 
living in Lebanon, and a document which classifies them in a "citizenship under 
study" category. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike Palestinians and other refugees in Lebanon who have a special travel 
document, these tribesmen have no passports and can travel almost nowhere. 
Syria is the only country that allows them inside its borders, just for brief 
visits. 
</P>
<P>
"We have become prisoners in our own land," said Sweid. 
</P>
<P>
The people of Wadi Khaled -- named after Khaled Ibn al-Walid, who drove out the 
Byzantine Christians -- are divided into tribes who trace their origin to what 
is now Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
Until the 1960s, they raised sheep in the bare rugged hills nearby. Then they 
turned to trade. 
</P>
<P>
"We are on the border between a socialist country (Syria) and a country that 
believes in free trade (Lebanon)," said Bashir Hammoud. 
</P>
<P>
Syria has strict import controls and the smuggled traffic across the Nahr 
el-Bared river into the country includes television sets, radios, videos, 
fruit, vegetables, canned food, coffee, sugar, building material, clothes and 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Wadi Khaled's marketplace, Al-Arida, is a favorite of Syrian families, with 
prices given in Syrian pounds that the merchants later change to dollars at the 
rate of 46 to a dollar. 
</P>
<P>
"We sell here what Syrians can only buy on the black market in their country. 
Everything they do not have they buy here," said Hammoud. 
</P>
<P>
The Ghannam tribe, the largest and most influential, boasts that its standard 
of living is higher than that of many people in the Lebanese capital, Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
Most of its members live in spacious cement houses with almost no furniture. 
They traditionally prefer sitting on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
Khaled Sweid, who holds a degree in mathematics, estimated that each family in 
the Ghannam tribe earned an average of about $200 per month compared to the 
national minimum wage of $30 per month. 
</P>
<P>
The residents of Wadi Khaled, all Sunni Muslims, have pleaded their case with 
all the governments that have ruled Lebanon since independence in 1943, but to 
no avail. 
</P>
<P>
Christian politicians, who hold key posts in the government, have resisted 
naturalizing 10,000 Muslims because it could upset the sectarian balance in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"Our plight became the subject of bickering among politicians," said a Ghannam 
tribesman, one of a group squatting in a smoke-filled room and sharing a meal 
of lamb and rice. 
</P>
<P>
"The solution for us lies with the Lebanese government. But now which one do we 
turn to?"
