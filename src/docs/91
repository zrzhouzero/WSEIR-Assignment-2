A missing teen-ager who authorities had stopped looking for over the protest of 
his parents was in fair condition after he was found wandering and disoriented 
in the Cleveland National Forest. Andrew Campbell, 15, of rural Guatay had been 
missing six days when he was found Friday in an oak grove by a father and son 
who had gone for a drive in the San Diego County backcountry. Campbell was 
suffering from minor frostbite.
