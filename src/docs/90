The American Legion's top recruiter in California turned in more than 200 phony 
membership registrations, including ones for a former German soldier and people 
who were dead, according to a Legion report. Costa Mesa Post Cmdr. Robert 
Hanson could be expelled from the American Legion, said state Cmdr. Andrew J. 
Steffanic. A three-member Legion committee issued its findings in a 13-page 
report signed by Steffanic. Hanson, 67, declined to discuss the report, but 
said, "I am contemplating legal action." The state American Legion awarded 
Hanson its Recruiter of the Year award after Hanson submitted 801 new 
memberships between July 1, 1987, and the 1988 convention. But the 
investigation found that only 18 of the supposed applicants paid dues by check, 
while Hanson wrote about 25 checks to the Costa Mesa post for $8,249.60 from 
his own account. The investigation began after national headquarters received 
inquiries from people wondering why they were receiving the American Legion 
Magazine. Hanson told state Legion officials that the 801 membership 
applications were stolen Aug. 26 when someone broke into his car.
