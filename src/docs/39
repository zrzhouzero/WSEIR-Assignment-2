ITALY DEBATES A CAPITAL IDEA -- DOWN WITH ROME!

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was the decision to make Rome the capital of Italy, taken in the last century, 
a mistake even bigger than the Colosseum itself? 
</P>
<P>
Yes, says Luigi Firpo, a history professor at Turin University and one of the 
luminaries among Italian intelligentsia. His opinion has probably been held by 
millions of other Italians since Rome actually became the Italian capital in 
1870. It is an opinion likely to gain adherents in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
Many Romans, or those who call themselves Romans, agree that the Eternal City 
seems each day less likely to hold on to that defiant label much longer. For 
them, Rome entered an alarming new chapter around AD 1950, the year when 
everyone who could switched from bicycles to cars, and folks flocked in from 
the hills to join the Roman circus. 
</P>
<P>
Firpo, who now also sits in Parliament, has said that the degradation of Rome 
is total. The Romans are vulgar, arrogant and ignorant, he claims, and the city 
"does not deserve to be the capital." For him, Rome is "the only Levantine city 
without a European quarter." 
</P>
<P>
His remarks, uttered first in Parliament then repeated and expanded in 
interviews, brought a denial from his political party that he was speaking for 
them, and then angry words from the city's political bosses. Some of their 
responses were impoverished, falling back on the line that Rome was the natural 
capital because it once had been the capital of the Western World. 
</P>
<P>
This, Firpo said, was "imperial rhetoric." Harking back to the empire was also 
one of Benito Mussolini's gambits, when the Italian dictator was playing from 
his balcony to cheering Roman crowds. Mussolini spoke of his Rome as being the 
city's third incarnation. First, the Rome of the Caesars, then the Rome of the 
Popes and finally the Rome of his glorious new Fascist regime. 
</P>
<P>
Prince Metternich, the 19th-Century Austrian statesman, dismissed the Italy of 
his time as being "more a geographical expression than a country." A little 
later, Firpo's native Piedmont, the northwestern Italian region that borders 
Switzerland and France, produced a handful of noblemen who thought that Italy 
should become a unified nation for the first time since the fall of the Roman 
Empire. In 1861 the Piedmontese Parliament declared that one day Rome would be 
the new Italian capital. The rest of the country was then under foreign 
domination; Rome and other parts of Italy were ruled by the Pope. 
</P>
<P>
When the Kingdom of Italy was proclaimed in Turin, one unification supporter, 
the Marquis Massimo D'Azeglio, said, "We've created an Italy -- now we must 
create the Italians." A strong argument could be made that his second goal is 
still a long way off. 
</P>
<P>
To relieve the Pope of his temporal powers, the Piedmontese entered Rome on 
Sept. 20, 1870, set up their king in what until the day before had been the 
Pope's residence and found themselves in possession of a city of fewer than 
200,000 people, living in a poverty unknown elsewhere on the Italian peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Today Rome's official population is 3 million, but each day it continues to 
attract migrants from hill towns and farms, drawn like moths to the bright 
lights. They soon find themselves living in shantytowns on the outskirts, 
without electricity or even plumbing. The arches of Roman aqueducts, built 
2,000 years ago to supply water for Nero's baths, are now bricked up by 
migrants and serve as dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
A cover story on a feisty Italian weekly, Espresso, some time ago was titled, 
"When the Capital Is Corrupt -- the Nation Is Infected." That was, and probably 
is, the attitude of Milan or any other modern metropolitan area in northern 
Italy toward the nation's capital. Each year the northern regions see their tax 
payments shipped to Rome for distribution in favor of southern Italy, an area 
just as rich in natural resources as the north and with double the 
unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto Moravia, the dean of Italian novelists, now a spry 83, is a Rome 
native. He was one of the first to jump on Firpo for his remarks, reminding him 
that when the Piedmontese entered Rome, they demolished many splendid buildings 
and private gardens to make Rome "more modern." A few days later, Moravia 
recalled that he himself had written against Rome a few years back and offered 
proof that Firpo was not all that original in his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Moravia had said: "Rome is not worthy of the name of being a European capital, 
like Paris or London. It is not a model for the nation to follow, but a sterile 
bureaucratic sponge that absorbs everything and gives nothing. Though the 
center of the church, it is the world's least spiritual city. Religion is 
present more with its bureaucracy than with its sentiment . . . . There is no 
circulation of ideas and persons in Rome, meaning there is no society of 
either." 
</P>
<P>
When Firpo was asked where he would prefer to have the Italian capital, he 
said, "Somewhere near Chiusi, but in open country." Both he and Moravia agree 
that Chiusi -- an old Etruscan town midway between Rome and Florence -- is only 
their utopian dream. It is too late for an Italian Pretoria, Canberra, Brasilia 
or Washington, even though with their cars, Italy's central government and the 
entire elephantine bureaucracy are destroying the remains of both ancient and 
modern Rome with a wanton thoroughness that would give pause to Attila the Hun. 
</P>
<P>
If it had not been deemed necessary to dislodge the Pope from his temporal 
control over Rome, some of the Piedmontese were touting Naples as the nation's 
capital. It was, after all, the largest Italian city and still a major cultural 
influence in Europe. However, the Sicilians said they would never again accept 
Naples as a sovereign seat. 
</P>
<P>
What a pity. The Neapolitans have been living by their wits for centuries. They 
are clever about inventing jobs and pulling rabbits out of other peoples' hats. 
They are nimble, too, as people who choose to live under a smoldering volcano 
need to be. They have produced great painters, poets, composers, writers, 
architects -- while Rome has failed to produce even one. 
</P>
<P>
Had Naples become the Italian capital 100 years ago, it would have tilted the 
scale in favor of the Italian peninsula becoming a Mediterranean country, not 
what it is now -- an angry mix, half-European and half-Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
That is what Luigi Firpo's rage against Rome is all about. He spoke for 
millions of Italians who consider themselves European, and, incidentally, 
probably spoke also for foreign Europeans who must do business in Italy and who 
find themselves beating their heads against the city's bureaucratic rubber 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
The only way out of this Italian dilemma is for the north to secede from the 
union. Both sides would be winners.
