Shen Xiaozhi, a 2-month-old foundling with a growth the size of a grapefruit on 
her back, is one of the lucky ones. She is being looked after in the 
well-equiped Beijing Children's Welfare Institute. But many of the thousands of 
unwanted babies being left in big cities in railway stations, outside 
hospitals, on docksides and even tossed on rubbish heaps cannot expect to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
It is a phenomenon that has grown steadily in recent years, partly as a result 
of the one-child policy but also because as social controls have loosened, 
China's rural population has become more mobile. 
</P>
<P>
The temptation for Chinese peasants to abandon their physically handicapped 
babies in big cities where there is at least a chance of getting the right 
medical care and treatment is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Notes, Money Attached 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the babies are found with money or notes attached to them but never 
with the parents' address," said Ye Tieliang, director of the Beijing Children 
Welfare Institute, the city's only state-run orphanage. 
</P>
<P>
According to the People's Daily, about 50 foundlings are left at Beijing's 
capacious and overcrowded railway station each year and similar numbers are 
left at other major stations. Between 1986 and 1987, nearly 700 foundlings were 
picked up in Canton city while an investigation in five of the province's 
counties showed that 862 babies were picked up. 
</P>
<P>
The babies are frequently female or suffering from Down's Syndrome, broken 
backs, deafness, blindness -- or even such easily cured defects as harelips. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Many Never Survive' 
</P>
<P>
Unofficial sources claimed, however, that the problem is far greater than is 
being admitted with thousands of children being left in Beijing alone. "Most of 
them never survive. They are usually too weak and they are an unwanted burden," 
the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year the legal newspapers said that in 15 months, 25 vagrants had 
been found dead at Beijing's railway station. The issue is highly sensitive and 
public security officials, who are responsible for handling the unwanted 
babies, declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Ye denied a People's Daily report that his institute received 141 handicapped 
foundlings last year. However, the Beijing municipal authorities have issued a 
circular warning people they will face prosecution if they abandon a child, an 
act that contravenes the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rewards Offered 
</P>
<P>
Rewards are being offered to people who help locate parents of the foundlings. 
Only 1.8% of the country's 10 million disabled children receive special care in 
child welfare institutions set up in the country's urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are 60 state-run child-welfare institutions that can provide 
reasonable service on a long-term basis to 11,000 disabled children in urban 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Institute appears to serve primarily handicapped children in return 
for financial donations. At the Tianjin children's welfare institute, officials 
say that what was originally designed for orphans has become "an abandoned 
babies" collecting house. 
</P>
<P>
"The cruel-hearted parents threw out their babies who were handicapped but they 
had money to buy refrigerators and color TV sets, so why didn't they send these 
children to hospital?" an official at Tianjin was quoted by the People's Daily. 
Few of the orphans are adopted and the Tianjin children's institute says it can 
no longer afford to pay for so many children's medical fees.
