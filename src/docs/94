Two men hired to monitor the performance of lottery ticket computers sued the 
California Lottery, complaining that officials ignored reports that computer 
problems were underreported. In the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit, Emmitt 
A. Allison and Randy Troxel alleged that they were placed on administrative 
leave and reassigned in September after they took their complaints to the state 
controller's office. State lottery officials have said the allegations were 
investigated and were unfounded. The complaint seeks unspecified damages and a 
court order forbidding lottery officials from destroying documents supporting 
Allison's and Troxel's findings.
