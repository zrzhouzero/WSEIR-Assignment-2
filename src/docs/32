What changes would you like to see in business practices and the workplace this 
year? How can business leaders and economic policy-makers improve the economy 
and the world in general in 1989? The Times ran these questions by people in 
various walks of life, and here are some of their answers: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Muriel Siebert, head of the Muriel Siebert &amp; Co. discount brokerage in New 
York, and first female member of the New York Stock Exchange: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see certain business practices regulated. I think that the 
leveraged buyouts show the greed of people at their worst. . . . The LBOs are 
bypassing the purpose of the capital-raising system. I think that to the extent 
that people were stockholders in these companies . . . they should be allowed 
to continue to have some kind of share in the profits (after the leveraged 
buyouts) because these moves were done while they were stockholders. 
</P>
<P>
"Must greed be the creed? I would like to see that also rolled over to our 
defense contractors. I am pro defense. I believe in a strong country because 
people mistake gentility for weakness. If (contractors) cheat on defense 
contracts, I don't see why they don't go to jail. . . . I just feel that if you 
are a major defense contractor, you owe a fiduciary responsibility to this 
country because defense expenditures are putting a pretty big toll on the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Brimmer, former member of the Federal Reserve Board and head of a 
Washington economics consulting firm: 
</P>
<P>
"My leading wish is that the nation deal with the federal budget deficit. I 
would like to see a substantial reduction in 1989 and extending over the next 
three years. I would strongly recommend that we raise taxes. There should be 
some moderation in the level of government expenditures, but the real problem 
is the lag in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
"I also would like to see more done for education by business. The kind of 
education I'm talking about is at the elementary and secondary level. 
Businesses are already contributing to colleges. Businesses should do likewise 
for elementary and secondary schools. Business people can play a role as 
counselors and teachers. A firm might make available an engineer or 
mathematician to go into schools and teach. Business should do more to offer 
on-the-job training for unskilled, or limited-skills, people, perhaps through a 
(lower) learning wage. We would give business tax credits to do this." 
</P>
<P>
William R. Robertson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles County Federation 
of Labor, AFL-CIO: 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to see a change in philosophy by the incoming President relating 
to labor relations and providing for fairness in our (labor) organizing efforts 
and contract negotiations. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to see some protection for workers losing their jobs because 
of mergers. It is a national disgrace. In too many mergers, the workers are the 
ones that suffer and the country as well. Something should be done to correct 
it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And, finally, this Administration should face reality in resolving the 
astronomical deficit." 
</P>
<P>
Steven D. Lydenberg, an associate with the "socially responsible" investment 
firm of Franklin Research &amp; Development: 
</P>
<P>
"There is an increasing interest around the country in social investing. People 
want to know not just the financial implications of making a commitment in a 
company, but also the social implication. That information is not very easy to 
come by. 
</P>
<P>
"So, if at the end of '89 corporations were disclosing in a uniform way their 
yield figures, their charitable contribution figures, the numbers of women and 
minorities in top management and board directors, their attitude on a number of 
comparable social issues, I would be very happy." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Borman, chairman of Patlex Corp. of Chatsworth, former astronaut and 
former chairman of Eastern Airlines: 
</P>
<P>
"We should begin to move toward taxing consumption -- a value-added tax. This 
is quite controversial as Al Ullman (Oregon Democrat and former chairman of the 
House Ways and Means Committee, who was defeated in 1988 after advocating a 
value-added tax) will tell you. But this taxing system is needed. It would 
certainly help our exports. Almost all of Europe is under the value-added 
taxing system. Also, it may encourage saving instead of consumption. One of the 
ways you discourage consumption is to tax it." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Harrington, co-chair of Democratic Socialists of America and author of 
"The Other America" and "The New American Poverty": 
</P>
<P>
"I hope Secretary of State Baker will build on the basic insights of former 
Treasury Secretary Baker (James Baker, former treasury secretary, was nominated 
by President-elect Bush to be Secretary of State) that a settlement of Third 
World debt is in the self-interest of America, opening up markets for business 
and labor. But then the new Baker will have to go far beyond the old, since 
Latin America now owes more than it did in 1982 when the crisis officially 
began, and several countries, including Argentina and Brazil, may see democracy 
subverted if current trends persist. 
</P>
<P>
"At home, the nation must recognize that we can't waste young people, and 
particularly minorities and women, on illiteracy, unemployment and unproductive 
low-wage work. We must invest mightily in education, training and job 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
Alan Bromberg, a securities law expert and professor at Southern Methodist 
University: 
</P>
<P>
"There are several things I would like most to see changed in the economy and 
business practices. One, more concentration by business and government, both 
here and abroad, on . . . the facilitation of international trade and 
investment. This would require wider horizons for business people . . . and 
more effort by government to reduce and ultimately eliminate all kinds of 
restrictions on the movement of products. 
</P>
<P>
"Two, I would like to see a national consensus developed, preferably in the 
form of federal legislation, on corporate takeovers and buyouts that would 
recognize the efficiencies and benefits they bring as well as the dislocations 
and hardships they can cause. This would involve tax policies and labor polices 
and limitations on the ability of states to Balkanize corporate law by 
different anti-takeover statutes everywhere. (There also should be) some kind 
of limitation on management self-entrenchment and self-enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we could use a lot of clarification of the securities laws. I think 
the courts have done a good job of saying what insider trading is. The kind of 
issues that are most difficult are what really is parking (of stock)? How much 
cooperation or similar action by different individuals or different groups of 
individuals makes it collaboration? These issues haven't been well resolved. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
Peter Bahouth, executive director of Greenpeace in Washington: 
</P>
<P>
"People now view threats to human security less in terms of political threats 
and more in environmental and economic terms. So for my wish list, I would ask 
first that we deal with the issue of the greenhouse effect. We better develop 
some alternative views in mass transportation and cut subsidies to reflect the 
true cost of fossil fuels in terms of pollution, along with the actual economic 
cost of development. Then, we could put more money into research and 
development of wind and solar energy. 
</P>
<P>
"(Also on my wish list is) peace on earth. If we want peace on earth, we have 
to start looking seriously at the fact that we are making more and more 
weapons, and in a process which endangers the health of American people. . . . 
Production plants have been proven to have released into the air and water 
radioactivity and toxic chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
"Also, it would be nice if we could learn that the rain forest affects all of 
us. We need to preserve it. And we would like the tuna industry to stop killing 
dolphins."
