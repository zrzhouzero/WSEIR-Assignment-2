Scrambling to meet its New Year's Eve deadline, New York City moved the last of 
448 homeless families from Manhattan's squalid Martinique Hotel. Located near 
Macy's department store, the turn-of-the-century hotel at Broadway and 32nd 
Street had become a national symbol of the problems faced by those too poor to 
afford housing. Faced with the threat of a federal funds cutoff and political 
pressure, Mayor Edward I. Koch's Administration pledged to close one of its 42 
welfare hotels by year's end. Koch has pledged to empty all the welfare hotels 
by July, 1990. The Martinique, where the city paid $1,800 per family, was 
closed first because it was "emblematic" of the conditions in other welfare 
hotels, said John Beckman, a city Human Resources Administration spokesman. 
Some of the relocated families were taken to newly rehabilitated apartments. 
Others were transfered to other city-run facilities for the homeless. The 
Martinique became a welfare hotel 15 years ago and at its height housed about 
500 adults and 1,500 children. It once featured a fashionable dancehall and 
popular nightclub.
