REVIEWING THE 'CITY HALL CIRCUS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bravo to The Times for printing the facts objectively about the mess in Long 
Beach resulting from unrestrained and unplanned development! 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Kell is typically being demagogic when he says there is "plenty of blame 
to go around" for the mushrooming apartment houses where single-family 
dwellings stood a few months ago. He and three other members of the City 
Council alone approved this sellout. What Kell really means is there is plenty 
of blame to try to spread around, which he is, of course, trying to do. 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Kell is exceeded in artful dodging by Councilwoman Jan Hall, who 
managed to lead both the city of Long Beach and the RTD into disaster 
simultaneously and then duck responsibility for both. 
</P>
<P>
Not mentioned in your coverage was the incredible ineptitude displayed by Kell, 
Hall and company, in the matter of the airport and the Pandora's box of noise 
and pollution that has opened up. While other cities have been going in the 
direction of placing airports away from city centers and population, our 
council, of course, is going in precisely the opposite direction and trying to 
expand one in a prime residential section of our city! 
</P>
<P>
One who has followed the City Hall circus would, of course, expect a "solution" 
from Kell and Hall for the parking problem they have created; they want to 
harass a tiny, politically unprotected minority of small boat owners who cause 
probably less than one-tenth of 1% of the problem ("Long Beach Thinks Again 
About Paving of Greenbelt," Times, Dec. 4). Thus they can continue to flail 
around while giving the superficial impression of doing something. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, to call the Long Beach Planning Department ineffectual is to be unduly 
charitable. They have proven themselves to be the Keystone Kops of urban 
planning. 
</P>
<P>
One fears the inmates are running the asylum. Please keep your spotlight 
focused; it may perchance do some good.
