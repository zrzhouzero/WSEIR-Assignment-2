Chicken is chicken, right? Well, not always, it appears. A new catalogue of 
chicken-based products available from Pierce Foods -- a leading supplier of 
pre-cooked menu items to the food service industry -- offers well over 200 
variations on the theme. There's Hume Dingher's 39 Seasonings Fast-Fry chicken, 
for instance ("Leave it to Hume to pack 39 herbs and spices, sea salts, and 
vegetables into one chicken recipe"). Or Greek Odyssey Chicken Breast Fillets 
("IT'S MICROWAVEABLE!"). Or Marinata Americana Chicken Thigh Fillets ("Here is 
a chicken fillet with a touch of greatness -- a lighter blend of those Central 
and Southern European spices America loves best"). 
</P>
<P>
Other varieties of Pierce poulet include Marinata/LS (Low Sodium) Curried Brest 
(sic), Microwaveable Wing-Dings, Roman-Fingers, Dip'n Chik'n Nuggets, Taste 
O'Mesquite Whole Halves (sic), Chik-Nachos and both Whirligigs and Whirlibirds 
(the latter, of course, being "Fully cooked, breaded chicken breast-and-thigh 
meat patties . . . seasoned with sage and onion croutons").

<P>
It's nice to know that somebody like Pierce is out there making the 
restaurateur's life easier, isn't it?

READ MY LICKS: What will (gulp) President Bush and Vice-President Quayle be 
eating on the evening of Inauguration Day? Hearts-of-palm blossoms, 
asiago-garlic bread and pheasant pizza, among other things. They'll be sampling 
these and other exotic delicacies at a reception in a new restaurant in the 
nation's capital called Adirondacks. Adirondacks, which is the work of L.A.'s 
own Michael McCarty (of Michael's in Santa Monica) and chef Jimmy Schmidt -- 
who also own the Rattlesnake Clubs in Denver and Detroit -- is an appropriate 
site for a presidential reception, as it happens, since it occupies the old 
presidential suite at Washington's Union Station, built for the use of Teddy 
Roosevelt. (Adirondacks was originally going to be yet another Rattlesnake 
Club, incidentally, but McCarty and Schmidt felt that an East-coast sort of 
name would be more appropriate. Personally, I think the Rattlesnake Club is a 
great name for a restaurant a few blocks from Capitol Hill.) 
</P>
<P>
"We're just going to serve wild hors d'oeuvres," says Schmidt. "You know those 
politician types. They like to stay on their feet and pump a lot of hands. 
They'll probably be so busy talking that they'll only take little bites of 
things -- so I've got to get my licks in quick." 
</P>
<P>
Among those licks will be spicy shrimp with achiote and picaya (hearts-of-palm 
blossoms) on lemon-bread croutons, asiago-garlic bread with black and green 
olive tapenade, and that pheasant pizza with the addition of Chinese-style plum 
sauce, hot mustard and mozzarella. 
</P>
<P>
Hey, wait a minute. Isn't Bush the guy who made fun of Michael Dukakis for 
talking about Belgian endive?

SALT AND PEPPER: Cafe Prego is new on La Cienega, on the site of the former 
L'Angolo (among other restaurants). . . . Marc Ehrler, former chef for the 
French ambassador in Washington, is the new executive chef at the San Ysidro 
Ranch in Montecito. Ehrler replaces Bryan Carr, who has moved to the El Encanto 
Hotel in Santa Barbara. . . .
