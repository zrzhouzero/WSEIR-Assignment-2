If Harlowe wants to see the real Soviet Union she should stay away from cities 
like Moscow and Leningrad. They represent their country as much as Tijuana and 
Juarez represent Mexico. Moscow and Leningrad have been set up to appeal to 
Western tourists. Mostly everything in these cities has been carefully 
orchestrated to create a positive image. I was born and raised in Moscow, so I 
am very much aware of how this system has been set up. If Harlowe wants her 
eyes opened she should see towns outside of the mainstream -- if she can get 
permission.
