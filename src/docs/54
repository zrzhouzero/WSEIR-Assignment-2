Obviously Harlowe had not stopped in other cities than Moscow and Leningrad, 
for instance Smolensk, Zagorsk, Kalinin and Yaroslavl in the Russian Republic. 
If you really want some fun, see what happens when you land in Lviv, Odessa, 
Ternopil or Kaniv in the Ukrainian Republic. As an exchange student who

believe in glasnost, then I have a bridge to sell you.
