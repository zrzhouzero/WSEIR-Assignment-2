The onset of the new Gorbachev policy of glasnost, commonly mistranslated as 
openness but closer in connotation to candor or publicizing, has complicated 
the task of Soviet secret-keepers and has allowed substantial new Western 
insights into Soviet society.
The author, a British-educated historian and economist, is a research associate 
with the Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies at the University of Alberta, 
and the academic style of the book is undisguised.
